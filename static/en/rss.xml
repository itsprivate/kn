&lt;p&gt;A lot of people struggle to tell their loved ones (partners, family, friends, etc.) about the bad things in their life because we don’t want to burden them with more bad news or more worries. When you’re so close to these people, you feel like you know all their worries and concerns already and you‘d feel guilty adding negativity on top of that. This type of thinking is so common, and incredibly unhealthy. Our loved ones are the exact people we should confide in to share our feelings and insecurities because our loved ones are going to be the ones most likely to help us get through them &lt;em&gt;without us breaking down or worsening our mental health&lt;/em&gt;. Togetherness. Improves. Mental. Health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use the people in your life who are there for you. You don’t have to ask them for money or advice. Use them to unburden yourself of the feelings you hide or things you feel you have to face alone. You’re not alone. You have people who love you and sometimes just talking with these people openly about your feelings is all the love you need. It doesn’t make you less strong or less independent. Talking about your feelings makes you stronger, I promise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this sentiment can help someone a little 💙&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for consumers, marketers specialize in the one skill they share with lawyers and salespeople; lying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out there&amp;#39;s actually no regulation on claims on package such as &amp;quot;Flushable Wipes&amp;quot; (Hell they&amp;#39;re boldly advertised and displayed as such) or &amp;quot;World&amp;#39;s Best Dildo&amp;quot; for that matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why ysk: Wipes (or excessive TP, paper towels)... really anything &lt;strong&gt;except&lt;/strong&gt; turds, moderate TP or severely eviscerated food waste via garburator... should NOT be flushed down any drains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rule most people I encounter prescribe is &amp;quot;out of sight out of mind&amp;quot;... which is a toxic mentality... often literally. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your toilet drains real slow, that&amp;#39;s more than often the reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Call a plumber to come snake your drain and immediately stop flushing wipes and other crap besides poop and TP.  Provided your plumbing doesn&amp;#39;t suck, you should almost never get clogs or slow draining in a modern plumbing system. If it does suck, getting your piping redone correctly up to your main stack can drastically improve that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if it doesn&amp;#39;t clog your drains it makes it&amp;#39;s way to the water treatment plant and can often clog and impede their pipes and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, do what old age homes do in their lobby bathrooms: put little trashcans with secure lids with a bag under the sink or some out of the way location and change it often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or just get a bidet. Give your brown eyed monster the proper bath it needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first discovered prostate stimulation on Reddit about a decade ago in my early 20s. Someone had written their story of having mind blowing orgasms and I decided I would try it for myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found that it felt great by myself, but I carried some pointless guilt and embarrassment for many years. It wasn&amp;#39;t until I accepted that I can enjoy it as a straight male that I really discovered how pleasurable prostate stimulation can be. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasnt until this discovery that I brought it up with my wife. Once I did, we began experimenting a bit more with toys specifically made for it. Butt plugs, vibrators, wands. I can honestly say it has produced some of the best sexual experiences I have ever had. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is even possible to orgasm from prostate stimulation alone, though I&amp;#39;ve never experienced it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you are even a little curious, do some research and try it out. Use your fingers or a toy meant for such things. Be safe, relax and enjoy. You may just find that you can be more comfortable with yourself when you begin breaking down stigmas such as this. I have.&lt;/p&gt;

There is evidence that about half of autistic people who go through ABA experience PTSD as a result of the process, which is founded on the concept of desensitizing autistic kids to make them appear “normal” (source linked at the end).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The foundation of ABA is that autistic kids must be “shaped” into people, and “non-autistic” behaviors are rewarded with treats, similar to dog training. This model of operant conditioning does two things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;it only impacts behavior, and not communication—ironic, considering autism is a disability of communication, and thus ignores the root of what autistic people need accommodations with. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;it teaches kids that all that matters is the needs of those around them, and not their own. By being punished or ignored for expressing their own needs, they are discouraged from having autonomy and learn that any attempts at self-advocacy are unacceptable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some programs also still use shock-therapy, which has been denounced by the UN as torture. (Side note: if you haven’t heard of the Judge Rotenberg Center, please look it up. It’s appalling.) But even “modern” ABA centers use the same foundation, which can still have harmful consequences. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much more safe and effective therapies are occupational therapy and speech and language therapy, which are tailored to individuals and are intended to promote autonomy and connect patients to necessary accommodations. &lt;/p&gt;

Just because someone is &amp;quot;Certified&amp;quot; means they were able to study and pass a test. Even if the certification is accredited, that just means that an accrediting agency (for profit) makes sure the tests are legitimate (for example: that they are proctored, that the company doesn&amp;#39;t lie about the cost, etc), not so much that the CONTENT is legitimate. Also, personal training is expensive. To pay someone so much money per hour that may not be qualified or educated seems silly. Make sure that you find a trainer that went to a hands-on program for personal training, one that is accredited as an education establishment (diploma), not just a &amp;quot;certification&amp;quot;.

&lt;p&gt;Many women are afraid of bruising men&amp;#39;s ego&amp;#39;s, them taking it violently, etc. So they take mediocre or even bad sex over telling them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The penis to a lot of women is secondary, while the foreplay tends to be the main event. Not saying that the penis isn&amp;#39;t important, but it&amp;#39;s just not as important as some men believe that it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: I did not mean &amp;quot;letting her&amp;quot; as a bad thing. I&amp;#39;m a woman by the way. I just mean that &amp;quot;some&amp;quot; (not all men), think of having a woman having orgasms or doing extra stuff for her is extra work/a chore for &amp;quot;some&amp;quot; of them. Like, it&amp;#39;s not something that they worry about as long as they get theirs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; The statistic only looks at fossil fuel companies and includes the emissions from their products, i.e. the fuel your car uses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit to clarify my intent:&lt;/strong&gt; This post is not meant to defend the negative impact of oil companies or similar on the climate and environment. It is meant to disarm the argument that individual action is futile because of the large impact of companies by showing how one specific statistic is commonly misinterpreted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of the many recent extreme wheather events around the world people have cited this number to deflect calls to take action against climate change away from individuals onto companies. While companies must be held accountable every one of us has the ability and needs to contribute to lessen the effects of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 71 % number shows up in the „&lt;em&gt;CDP Carbon Majors Report 2017&lt;/em&gt;“ by the Carbon Disclosure Project, a non-profit that discloses information on environmental impact [1]. The report was published on July 10th 2017 [2] and The Guardian wrote an article titled „&lt;em&gt;Just 100 companies responsible for 71% of global emissions, study says&lt;/em&gt;“ the same day [3]. I believe this to be the souce of the above claim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Carbon Majors Report specifically aims at fossil fuel investors [4, p. 2] and the 100 companies in question are the 100 largest producers of fossil fuels. They look at fossil fuel emissions as the sum of two things [5, p. 3] :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All fossil fuels a company uses in the &lt;strong&gt;extraction and production of fossil fuels&lt;/strong&gt; (Scope 1 emissions)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emissions from the „&lt;strong&gt;use of sold products&lt;/strong&gt;“, meaning the emissions from the use of the manufactured fossil fuels. This typically represents &amp;gt; 90 % of all emissions of a company. (Scope 3 Category 11 emissions)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this is all about fossil fuel companies the „use of sold products“ includes the fuel your car burns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 71 % number refers to the sum of CO2 emissions of those companies between 1988 and 2015 listed in the „Past accountability“ section of the report [4, p. 8]. This is meant to display the significant contribution of just a few companies, but cannot easily be compared to other emission statistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One response to people citing this number here on reddit is that it only refers to &lt;strong&gt;industrial emissions&lt;/strong&gt;. This is true, but it is important to look up how the report defines industrial emissions before comparing this to other statistics. According to the accompanying methodology report industrial greenhouse gas emissions include &lt;strong&gt;all man-made greenhouse gasses except carbon dioxide relating to land-use change, and methane deriving from farming, landfills, and other non-industrial sources.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I interview applicants both for professional positions and for graduate school, and this has to be one of my biggest pet peeves.  I&amp;#39;m not alone, so I can assure you that this mistake will make you seem unprofessional in the eyes of many prospective employers.  What shocks me most is that I see it in about half of the applications/resumes I receive nowadays, and these are from highly educated people!  So, I feel the need to give some advice here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short: the phrase &amp;quot;demonstrated history of X&amp;quot; has a very specific meaning.  It&amp;#39;s used to communicate that you&amp;#39;ve accomplished something special and that you have the results to show for it.  You want to use it when talking about your achievements - it&amp;#39;s a bragging phrase.  You don&amp;#39;t want to use it when you&amp;#39;re stating simple facts about your work history, because those speak for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, you don&amp;#39;t need to tell your prospective employer that you have a &amp;quot;demonstrated history of working in finance.&amp;quot;  That&amp;#39;s abundantly clear from your resume, and it isn&amp;#39;t impressive.  Working in finance isn&amp;#39;t some kind of accomplishment in and of itself; the guy who showed up for the first day of work and slapped his boss has a demonstrated history of working in finance, too.  That just means you showed up to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, what you &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; want to tell your prospective employer is that you have a &amp;quot;demonstrated history of effectively leading multidisciplinary teams,&amp;quot; or a &amp;quot;demonstrated history of improving customer retention rates.&amp;quot;  You&amp;#39;re talking about specific things you&amp;#39;ve done well in your career.  Don&amp;#39;t tell them you have a &amp;quot;demonstrated history of working as a landscape designer&amp;quot;; tell them you have a &amp;quot;demonstrated history of designing unique landscape features for clients with diverse landscaping needs.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this still doesn&amp;#39;t make sense, then just don&amp;#39;t ever put the words &amp;quot;demonstrated&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;history&amp;quot; next to each other in a sentence and you&amp;#39;ll be fine!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Free guest pass” is more often than not a way for the gym to collect leads , then bother the ever-loving F out of you trying to get you to sign up/buy personal training/ etc. You will most likely be required to go on a tour and hear a sales pitch before you can even try out the gym. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, once your free trial is over, expect them to continue reaching out to you. Forever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why YSK: You can avoid a major headache by not using these, or at the very least you’ll know what’s coming. IMO, you’re better off paying whatever their one-day fee is, and trying it out that way before signing up, or using a friend’s guest privileges (different than “guest pass”).&lt;/p&gt;

So if a clump of dirt, for example, falls off of the bed sides or the truck hits a bump and a rock comes out of the bed, and it hits your car, they are liable for the repairs to your car. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advice I was given by a LEO was to get the information from the truck and report it to my insurance, and let them fight the trucking company. The information you’d need includes the company name, truck license plate number or truck number (companies with multiple trucks will generally put a number somewhere on the side of the hood, or a rear corner of the cab; it’s usually a two or three digit number), what road you were on and where on that road it happened, direction of travel for both of you, and what it was that caused the damage (if you’re able to tell.) If you can’t tell what exactly it was that hit your vehicle, don’t lie and say it was something, because if you say it was a rock, but the truck was hauling mulch, they can use that to contest your claim. Also, if you can’t safely read or find a license plate (most states don’t have rear plates for trucks that size), a description of the truck. This isn’t a comprehensive list of details that you should compile, as always, the more information you have the better off you’ll be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be clear: this only includes things that fall off of or out of the trucks. It does not include things that may have been kicked up off the road. For example, if a truck hits a rock on the road, and that causes it to fly up and hit your windshield, that’s considered a road hazard, and they &lt;em&gt;aren’t&lt;/em&gt; liable for that.&lt;/p&gt;

I started doing some digging online and calling some other dealerships and they confirmed the information. We&amp;#39;re not talking about &amp;quot;Buy Here Pay Here&amp;quot; car lots.. I&amp;#39;m talking about l&lt;em&gt;egitimate dealerships.&lt;/em&gt; And technically, you consent to it since it&amp;#39;s hidden in the fine print of all those contracts that you sign at the time of purchase. And you most likely paid an extra couple hundred dollars for them to install it! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why YSK: The really interesting part is even if you pay for your car in full at the time of purchase, you still have the GPS and ignition cutoffs pre-installed. But &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; can&amp;#39;t use them. &lt;em&gt;You&lt;/em&gt; don&amp;#39;t have access to these services, even though it&amp;#39;s always actively running (as long as your battery is hooked up). &lt;em&gt;You&lt;/em&gt; aren&amp;#39;t notified if someone accesses that information without your knowledge. The dealership (and whoever else) could access this information any time they want for any reason they want because &lt;em&gt;you can&amp;#39;t confirm if/when it&amp;#39;s happening because you don&amp;#39;t have access to it.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I paid for my Jeep in full at the time of purchase and I can confirm the Jeep dealership installed a GPS tracker and ignition cutoff in my vehicle as well. I cut the wires, spliced everything back together and called the dealership that sold it to me. I asked them to give me access to the tracking and ignition cut off services, all the records and documents relating to these devices, and a list of anyone whose ever viewed or pinged my location with their reason for doing so. I was told &amp;quot;we can&amp;#39;t do that&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not sure where that information would be.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These GPS trackers theoretically could be placed anywhere. But 95% of the time they&amp;#39;re located under the steering wheel by the OBD port and/or fuse box. You&amp;#39;ll need to remove the plastic panel from below your steering wheel to see the device(s) but it&amp;#39;s pretty easy - there will be 3 or 4 screws at the bottom of the plastic panel (just above the gas/brake pedal). After you remove the panel search YouTube for some videos of people removing the GPS trackers and proceed to cut them off your vehicle. It will be a black box that looks different from the rest, most likely spliced to your OBD port. Note: Be sure to read the terms of your lease/loan (if you have one) to make sure you&amp;#39;re not violating your contract by removing these devices. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no idea how this is legal for them to do and seriously, FUCK the dealerships who install these and sneak it past customers. Read the fine print like a hawk, question everything, and if you have one of these installed, I suggest removing it and running it TF over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(For context, I&amp;#39;m in the USA)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally, while learning English have had a lot of moments where I’ve said something seemingly normal that a fluent speaker could interpret as being an innuendo, or have asked store clerks if pork products are halal because I did not know what the word “pork” meant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These things are obviously embarrassing when pointed out, which is a kind thing to do because it helps me learn, but way too often have people taken it too far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course i can see the humor in this and I always do laugh with them, but man does it hurt when they straight up ridicule you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was scared to speak English because I didn’t want to say silly things, and it took me a long time to become confident &lt;em&gt;enough&lt;/em&gt; in my english.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am now learning another language, which is similarly difficult and I’ve started experiencing this again. Which reminded me of the pain I felt learning English. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please be considerate to non-fluent speakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These companies will then collect all the donations and give them to the charity. From the company, not the consumer. By doing this, it becomes a major tax write off in the USA, making them have to pay less overall tax. Those tax dollars help improve general life in the country, including roads and education. Don&amp;#39;t give major companies a way to cheat on taxes. &lt;/p&gt;

Depending on the store, they are often unreasonable and impossible to maintain, to &amp;quot;promote more productivity&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, this means that customers who read the menu, don&amp;#39;t pull away fast enough, or generally spend more than 90 seconds (total) in the drive thru, can be a cause of a lot of stress on cashiers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As anyone who&amp;#39;s worked customer service can tell you, managers often make life much harder. This standard was a huge problem when I worked a drive thru a few years ago. Threats of being written up or fired over a car that took two minutes to leave the store from the time it pulled to the speaker is ridiculous, but sadly also a daily occurrence. And the poor customer who just needed to read the menu has no idea that maybe &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; were the straw that broke the camel&amp;#39;s back and lost that person their job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you can do: if you don&amp;#39;t know what you want, go inside if you&amp;#39;re able. They&amp;#39;ll be trying to get your food almost as quickly, but they won&amp;#39;t get in trouble. You&amp;#39;ll also have a much easier time making special requests or instructions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you really can&amp;#39;t go inside, look it up. Figure out what you want before arriving. Streamlining the process will come back around when all the employees love you for making their jobs easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, please, don&amp;#39;t verbally abuse the cashiers like every other customer. You&amp;#39;re not above them. If you want to be treated like royalty, fast food isn&amp;#39;t the place the do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: A lot of the comments seem to be about this similar point. No, none of this is the customer&amp;#39;s responsibility. Yes, it&amp;#39;s a horribly flawed system. Still, that doesn&amp;#39;t stop that cashier from learning what an anxiety attack is at their first job&lt;/p&gt;

So I guess this is my RTFM for cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For people who have never had cannabis (or who haven’t had it in recent months), you might want to try taking only 1 MG of THC. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 MG: Some people will feel mild euphoria, some will feel nothing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 - 3 MG: Some people will feel euphoria and psychedelic effects, some will feel very little&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3 - 5 MG: Many people will feel euphoria and psychedelic effects, some people might feel overwhelmed or anxious&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5 - 10 MG: Most people will feel strong euphoria and psychedelic effects, many people will feel overwhelmed or anxious&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start low and go slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s better to take too little than to take too much. If you take too much you can experience mild to severe anxiety, panic attacks, and other unpleasant feelings. In some cases, people have a very bad experience that can cause lasting trauma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Know your dose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking 1 MG of THC on a Friday night, with a buddy to keep you company, is a great idea for your first time consuming cannabis. If you don’t experience any effects, take 2 MG the next time. Then 3 MG the next time. Give your body a full 24 hours to process the experience before trying again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, after you’ve gotten to understand how to reach a place of mild euphoria, excitement, or relaxation (depending on the product you take), you can try more if you want a stronger effect—or not!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s fine if you want to blast off to the moon and take more, but I&amp;#39;m mainly just writing this for people who might not know how big a difference 1 MG vs. 10 MG can be for a cannabis newbie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Safe travels.&lt;/p&gt;

The most popular thing companies want you to do is download a 2 factor authentication app for your work resources. Also companies expect you to add your corporate email to your personal phone. These two things are just privacy disasters waiting to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I administer a small exchange (Microsoft Outlook/Office email service) server and while I disable as much of it as I can the amount of personal information companies can take from your personal device without you knowing is quite scary. I also manage another solution that pulls a lot of information as well that it certainly should not. On top of that almost every organization has the ability to remotely wipe with no notification on your device (most common is through you adding your work email to your phone it gives them that authority), if you are not doing backups or even if you are you could be left with a lot of lost information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might be annoying to have 2 phones but its also to help save your sanity. When you have a work mobile phone and a personal when you are on vacation or after hours you can leave/turn off your &amp;quot;work&amp;quot; phone and take some much needed rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My rule is simple: My personal phone is for Reddit, to text/call friends &amp;amp; family, and all the normal stuff. My work phone is just that, it has my company email and company required apps and thats it. If work wiped my work phone then in the end nothing much is lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a perfect world companies should be providing mobile devices to all employees expected to need to do anything with said device, but the small increase in an extra mobile plan each month will pay off for you in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

You just want to expose the affected areas to heat. I’ve found the best way is to use a hairdryer set on high and simply leaving it over each bite for as long as possible, ideally around 15 seconds. The area will itch during the process for a few seconds and then immediately go away. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively you can heat up a spoon over a stovetop and apply it directly to the skin. Just make sure it’s hot but not too hot that it’ll burn you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why YSK: mosquito bites can be really annoying and scratching the area can make itching worse and even cause infection. This method is safe, simple, uses equipment nearly everyone has and can be done in minutes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as why it works, it has to do with heat breaking down heparin, which is found in mosquito saliva. It prevents clotting which makes it easier to suck blood. Unfortunately it also causes inflammation and itching. Heat destroys heparin and the foreign proteins, stopping the autoimmune response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand it&amp;#39;s expensive to see a derm(I live in US), but calculate how much &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;TIME&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; you&amp;#39;ve spent trying and failing various products for your acne. There&amp;#39;s a chance it&amp;#39;s cheaper to see a derm than continuing to spend money on products aimlessly. In total, from first visiting my dermatologist to curing my acne, it was about $900. I&amp;#39;ve had acne for almost 7 years, I guarantee I&amp;#39;ve spent more than $1000 over those years on acne cures and I had nothing to show for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people work better in the morning, some people work better in the afternoon, some people work better in the evening. So see when the child is better at being more productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every adult is different, so it should be safe to say that every child is different as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They could also have a mental disorder or something else entirely that you could look into, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also: Parents tend to tell kids to do it, instead of explaining why something must be done. So, explain why that something must be done: Outside of just saying: &amp;quot;Because I said so&amp;quot; Would go a long way, as well. And explaining how something is done, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes kids, just like adults, also just don&amp;#39;t feel like doing xyz at that moment, either. But adults tend to have more discipline in order to do that x thing, even if they don&amp;#39;t want to do it, compared to kids. (Or they (adults) wait until later to do it). So you shouldn&amp;#39;t give a kid such a hard time, when an adult acts the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kids could also be bullied at school as well, or their teachers not care or whatever reason, elsewhere, as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many Soviet era films are life changing experiences, but starting out watching movies in foreign languages is hard especially when those movies are increasingly unavailable. Here&amp;#39;s some of my favourite Soviet films available at the channel:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stalker (1979):
&lt;a href=&quot;https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRDYpCmMcM&amp;amp;t=715s&quot;&gt;https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRDYpCmMcM&amp;amp;t=715s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Everything made by Andrei Tarkovsky really)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come and see (1985):
&lt;a href=&quot;https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UkkJZweYaLI&amp;amp;t=49s&quot;&gt;https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UkkJZweYaLI&amp;amp;t=49s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kin-Dza-Dza  (1986):
&lt;a href=&quot;https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=EYHv8eJrW2Y&quot;&gt;https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=EYHv8eJrW2Y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cranes are flying (1957):
&lt;a href=&quot;https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2OccZQmxKac&quot;&gt;https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2OccZQmxKac&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WHY YSK Finding legal ways to watch your favorite Soviet films is at times impossible, but Mosfilm studio has slowly been making their films easily accessible on YouTube for ten years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Just found out YouTube has put ads in the middle of some films. Just a year ago the films only had one ad in the beginning... Reason i didn&amp;#39;t find out is i got YouTube premium&lt;/p&gt;

But it&amp;#39;s our nature to ask questions where we want both honest feedback from our SO but also want validation. Instead, express your feelings about the topic or question at hand and request feedback on that emotion. Examples at the end. Also, while this can apply to any relationship, I wanted my focus on this post to be for couples in romantic relationships. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s tough to answer: don&amp;#39;t you absolutely love this new recipe I made right after my long day of work standing on my feet and getting exhausted? Do I look good in this outfit that doesn&amp;#39;t match and is totally inappropriate for the event we are attending? *Do I look fat, BE HONEST? *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an alternative which will help you get the feedback and validation you need while also receiving constructive criticism that won&amp;#39;t feel like an attack when you&amp;#39;re in need of a self esteem boost, you need to rephrase the question into an open ended statement that encourages a conversation, not a yes or not absolute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey, I found this new recipe online I wanted to try but I didn&amp;#39;t feel too confident while I was making it. I feel like there may be something missing but what do you think?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m trying something new with this outfit. There&amp;#39;s just something about it I really like but is there anything I should change about it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; I haven&amp;#39;t been eating well or exercising as much as I used to. I don&amp;#39;t feel happy with how I look. I just feel like I look fat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That last one is always difficult to address in any kind way as we have been conditioned to focus on our appearance well beyond any other aspect of our life. But this will at least help your SO take the hint to be encouraging and supportive rather than force them to lie or be awkward.&lt;/p&gt;
