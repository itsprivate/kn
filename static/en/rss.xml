&lt;p&gt;Why YSK: PatientRightsAdvocate.org estimates &lt;a href=&quot;https://static1.squarespace.com/static/60065b8fc8cd610112ab89a7/t/60f1c225e1a54c0e42272fbf/1626456614723/PatientRightsAdvocate.org+Semi-Annual+Hospital+Compliance+Report.pdf&quot;&gt;that less than 6% of hospitals are compliant&lt;/a&gt;. You can report your hospital for non-compliance  to the Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services &lt;a href=&quot;https://cms.gov1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_b2fAQwrDLIC7Iyx&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, they can be fined for each day they are noncompliant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cms.gov/hospital-price-transparency/hospitals&quot;&gt;To be compliant, a hospital must make &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; of the following information publicly available on their website&lt;/a&gt; (they can&amp;#39;t require you to email them for the information, or require an account, password, or fee):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.)  Single &lt;strong&gt;machine-readable digital file&lt;/strong&gt; containing the following standard charges for all items and services provided by the hospital: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;gross charges&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;discounted cash prices &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;payer-specific negotiated charges&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;de-identified minimum and maximum negotiated charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.) Display of at least 300 “shoppable services” (or as many as the hospital provides if less than 300) that a health care consumer can schedule in advance. &lt;strong&gt;Must contain plain language descriptions of the services&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;group them with ancillary services&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

An explanation like this can be quite powerful in that it can make you aware of the circumstances that shape who you become, especially if you’re the kind of person who thinks their character is all their fault. It’s also valuable for parents to know how their interactions with their kids can become neurally embedded and affect the children’s later life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this is about assigning blame to parents or rejecting personal responsibility. It’s also not something I read in a self-help book or some such. Attachment theory has been backed by a lot of research in psychology and has inspired some of the most forward-thinking studies in neuroscience, too. Below I’ll sum up some findings from two decades of research by psychologist Mario Miculincer - and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mario-Mikulincer/publication/285623488_The_Attachment_Behavioral_System_In_Adulthood_Activation_Psychodynamics_And_Interpersonal_Processes/links/573d709808ae298602e5a533/The-Attachment-Behavioral-System-In-Adulthood-Activation-Psychodynamics-And-Interpersonal-Processes.pdf&quot;&gt;here’s a link&lt;/a&gt; with an in-depth (100 pages) report on his research.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, here we go:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, according to attachment theory, children of sensitive parents develop secure attachment. They learn to be okay with negative feelings, ask others for help, and trust their own ability to deal with stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, children of unresponsive caregivers can become insecurely attached. They get anxious and upset by the smallest sign of separation from their attachment figure. Harsh or dismissive parenting can lead to avoidant infants who suppress their emotions and deal with stress alone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interactions with early attachment figures become neurally encoded and can be subconsciously activated later in life, especially in stressful and intimate situations.  For example, as adults, anxious people often develop low self-esteem and are easily overwhelmed by negative emotions. They also tend to exaggerate threats and doubt their ability to deal with them. Such people often exhibit a desperate need for safety and seek to “merge” with their partners. They can also become suspicious, jealous or angry without objective cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avoidant people want distance and control. They detach from strong emotions (both positive and negative), and avoid conflicts and intimacy. Their self-reliance means that they see themselves as strong and independent, but this can mean that their close relationships remain superficial, distant and unsatisfying. And while being emotionally numb can help avoidant people during ordinary challenges, in the midst of a crisis, their defences can crumble and leave them extremely vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Single-Stream recycling, where you have 1 curbside recycling bin, crushed aluminum is more difficult to be properly sorted by the automated sorting machines and can end up in the landfill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have multi-stream recycling, where you have to sort out the various materials into separate bins, then it is ok to crush aluminum cans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit 1: Brain mixed up single and multi-stream. Single stream is 1 curbside bin. Title should read &amp;quot;If you use Single-Stream recycling, DO NOT crush aluminum cans.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

If I would have known, it would have saved me a lot of money and time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fixing your female dog/cat before their first heat cycle can prevent illnesses and help them live a healthier life. Spaying helps prevent uterline infections and tumors (which can be malignant or cancerous) in 50% of dogs and 90%. It also helps them not have to go into heat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Dogs will have their first heat cycle between 4 months and 2 years with the average of 6 months. Cats are roughly around 6-9 months. I am not advocating for spaying/neutering at the earliest possible date (8 weeks  old)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, about 2 months ago, after it being on my mind for so long and depression had set it, I had had enough and visited my doctor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He examined me, it took 20 seconds(which wasn&amp;#39;t that bad) and he said that he couldn&amp;#39;t feel any abnormalities but said we&amp;#39;d do an ultrasound to be sure...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was scheduled for a week later. It was the longest week of my life. I was sure that, that&amp;#39;s it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the ultrasound time came along on a Friday. The technician wasn&amp;#39;t as nice as my doctor and basically scaned me with a straight face and said that the radiologist will be in touch with my doctor on Monday. So another horrible long weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My doctor contacted me with my results after what seemed like months. Turns out that I have &amp;quot;varicocele&amp;quot; which is a varicose vein in my testicle.

This is tragic, because if they&amp;#39;d only known a little about the design of these barriers they would have been okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The arms are &lt;em&gt;designed&lt;/em&gt; to be driven through. They&amp;#39;re typically made of easily broken wood or flexible plastic, and are considered a consumable part as this happens (by accident or on purpose) all the time. Some are made of metal, but with a breakaway joint at the base so that they can be reused in areas where they&amp;#39;re broken especially often. Counterweighted designs will automatically lift and stay up if broken. Some of the best designs can even log the event for security and electronically self reset!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all cases, all damage to your vehicle will range from none to cosmetic scratches. I can imagine a freak scenario where you could end up with a cracked windshield, but that&amp;#39;s still better than getting hit by a train or being trapped in a parking structure in a fire. It costs a maximum of a couple hundred bucks to fix one of these arms, but in a real emergency you shouldn&amp;#39;t be worried about that and hopefully wouldn&amp;#39;t be charged for it. Expect steep fines if you do it to avoid paying for parking or to beat a train though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weed use (specifically delta 9-thc) can reduce REM sleep. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/43/Supplement_1/A62/5846891&quot;&gt;Source 1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cpt1976196782&quot;&gt;Source 2&lt;/a&gt;) if you are still having vivid dreams every day, then congratulations, your REM sleep is probably fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason this is important is because the lack of REM sleep is associated with decreased learning ability and decreased memory consolidation. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982217313295&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has also been studied that cannabis use among REM-sleep deprived rats shows that they become more aggressive. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00426483&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be able to circumvent this to some extent if you go to bed completely sober, but I&amp;#39;m not sure if doing that allows for full REM cycles again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary: Smoking delta-9 THC (weed), especially before bed, can reduce your time in REM sleep. This causes you to have worse memory, and makes it harder to learn new things and new habits. This is stuff that weed by itself already makes harder for a lot of people, so it&amp;#39;s even worse when combined with lack of REM sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: by the way, this isn&amp;#39;t to say that you should never smoke weed before bed or for nightmares or anything like that. I&amp;#39;m just trying to inform more people because I&amp;#39;ve been experiencing REM-sleep deprivation for years now and had no idea until now that it had any effects other than just blocking dreams. And now that I&amp;#39;ve been trying to dream more I feel like I am getting more restful sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a baby, I’d keep “Rei “ close always. All the kisses and pets, naps together, followed by long nights awake to feed her and potty. She was/is my heart. She knows nothing but loVe and affection. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What they mean is, &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know anything about recycling them and I don&amp;#39;t want to be bothered, go away.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to a hardware store (thinking that maybe it was a gas station specific thing) and the employees all said the same thing. I called Blue Rhino up and had their customer service tell the employees how to do recycling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best part? When I went to the cage - there were two canisters next to it.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strip your bed after you&amp;#39;re done with it. It&amp;#39;s instinct to try and make the bed but please don&amp;#39;t. Just take all the blankets and pillow cases off and throw them in a pile somewhere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#39;t leave trash. Seriously. You aren&amp;#39;t a child ffs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Control your blood. People bleed like, SO much in hotel rooms. That is a biohazard and we have to go way out of our way to follow procedure. Throw your bloody tissues in the garbage. Try not to get blood on sheets or carpet, and if you do (it happens) please tell a staff member ASAP so we can be prepared to treat it and so it doesn&amp;#39;t stain. Same goes for any bodily fluid. We aren&amp;#39;t judging you if your kid pees the bed, we just need to know so we can treat it. If you get injured, we have first aid kits all over and will gladly patch you up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#39;t leave your soaking wet towels just laying around. Hang them up to dry, please.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you smoke weed in the room, leave some for us. We can smell it, we want some, and you&amp;#39;re a tease. We&amp;#39;ll also &amp;quot;forget&amp;quot; who was in that room and won&amp;#39;t charge you for damages a good amount of the time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try not to use two beds in a double bedded room if you only need one. It&amp;#39;s twice the work. I do get the desire to jump from one to the other though, so I&amp;#39;m not too mad when I see it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(this one doesn&amp;#39;t actually help us, it just helps you) If you put a bag over your smoke detector cause you&amp;#39;re smoking in your room, congrats, you&amp;#39;re a dumbass who just snitched on yourself. Your cigarette won&amp;#39;t set off the alarms and we can&amp;#39;t smell it half the time. But if we see a bag on your detector, we&amp;#39;re charging you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You know what? Kick your kids out. Just make them sleep in the halls. We hate rooms with kids.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tip. We&amp;#39;re wage workers. We don&amp;#39;t get paid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But OP,&amp;quot; I hear you say, &amp;quot;that&amp;#39;s all common sense!&amp;quot;. To which I raise you: no the fuck it isn&amp;#39;t, apparently. If I clean 10 rooms, like 7 of them will have people who were dicks staying there. Consider us, please. Our job sucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why YSK:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Our job kinda sucks and making it easier is a super Chad thing to do. Also, it might save you money, because if you piss us off we will advocate for the hotel to charge you more for any damages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see the inputs and output here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.calculator.net/sample-size-calculator.html?type=2&amp;amp;cl2=99&amp;amp;ss2=427&amp;amp;pc2=79&amp;amp;ps2=332677777&amp;amp;x=74&amp;amp;y=24#findci&quot;&gt;https://www.calculator.net/sample-size-calculator.html?type=2&amp;amp;cl2=99&amp;amp;ss2=427&amp;amp;pc2=79&amp;amp;ps2=332677777&amp;amp;x=74&amp;amp;y=24#findci&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This results in &amp;#39;margin of error&amp;#39; 5.09%, which means there is a 99% chance the actual value is between (79% - 5.09%) and (79% + 5.09%)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;= approximately between 74% and 84%.&lt;/p&gt;

Not only actual advertising, but even shareholder letters can paint a rosy picture to encourage investment or act as informal promotional material, over-emphasizing things that went well and burying things that didn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, under US law, every large (over $10M in assets) publicly traded company must file an annual financial and risk analysis report called a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_10-K&quot;&gt;Form 10-K&lt;/a&gt; to the Securities Exchange Commission. This report must, by law, have an honest and undistorted statement of financial performance, risk analysis, executive compensation, major corporate decisions, and other relevant information. Since it is filed to the government, rather than to the general public, corporations are far more careful about ensuring what they say is truthful and representative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether or not you are a shareholder, a consumer, or just a concerned citizen, Form 10-K may expose inner dealings that a corporation might otherwise prefer to keep under wraps. For example, a quote from EA&amp;#39;s Form 10-k report from 2017 states: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Negative player sentiment about our business practices also can lead to investigations from regulatory agencies and consumer groups, as well as litigation, which, regardless of their outcome, may be costly, damaging to our reputation and harm our business.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by a post I saw in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/IsItBullshit/&quot;&gt;r/IsItBullshit&lt;/a&gt; that I commented on and decided it is worth signal boosting because its surprising how widespread of a rumor this is. Pretty much copy and pasted my comment from that thread, removing some profanity. Also, to be clear, I&amp;#39;m just trying to be informative! I&amp;#39;m not trying to call anybody out, just dispel an oft perpetuated rumor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The &amp;quot;active&amp;quot; ingredient in Poison Ivy that causes the rash is Urushiol, it is a hapten molecule which means sticks to your cells (in this case, skin cells), causing your immune cells (CD8+ killer T cells) to recognize your own cells as foreign and attack, leading to a type IV hypersensitivity reaction.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a fundamental aspect of adaptive immune response and if you don&amp;#39;t experience type IV reactions at all, you probably have a greater immune problem.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;If you doubt me, that&amp;#39;s fine, but I advise you to actually look it up because pretty much any medical resource will tell you the same thing. It is not the same type of allergy as we commonly associate with seasonal or food allergies. Repeated exposure to poison ivy sensitizes you to it precisely because the reaction is mediated by the adaptive immune response, which has &amp;quot;memory&amp;quot; and reacts more intensely each time you are re-exposed to a given compound or microbe.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many compounds are like this. For example, the resin used for 3D printing does the same thing, though I&amp;#39;m not quite sure what it is exactly in the resin that is responsible for this. Each subsequent exposure results in a more dramatic effect. &lt;strong&gt;The reality is that the people who say they aren&amp;#39;t allergic just haven&amp;#39;t been exposed to it very much and/or are careful enough around it to avoid exposure altogether.&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#39;ve never had a reaction before, but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean I&amp;#39;m going to go frolicking through patches of poison ivy butt naked. My dad was &amp;quot;immune&amp;quot; until about a decade ago when he got a horrible reaction while doing yardwork, nearly had to go to the ER because he unknowingly spread it all over his body. Tolerance can be genetically inherited, but as you age, various factors (something to do with changes in various protein and immune marker expression) can cause you to lose that tolerance even without exposure, similar to how some people &amp;quot;randomly&amp;quot; develop a seafood allergy.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the 15% figure often touted online is also false if you are talking about total immunity. You may be &amp;quot;tolerant&amp;quot; of it but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean you won&amp;#39;t eventually have some reaction. I&amp;#39;m not gonna beat up anybody for spreading this rumor, but it *is* potentially harmful disinformation and people should know the truth so they don&amp;#39;t end up hurting themselves or others unintentionally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this post saves somebody from an avoidable rash and teaches people to be a bit more cautious around poison ivy, even if you are tolerant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facial fillers, or derma fillers, have become immensely popular in the past years with people as young as teenagers getting the procedures done, sometimes with dire consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professionals lure in clients with the promise that the procedures are temporary, meaning that whatever you pump into your face will be absorbed or broken down over time and you&amp;#39;ll be back to your normal self without issue or any aftermath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MRI scans of people who&amp;#39;ve had derma fillers injected show that the fillers aren&amp;#39;t being broken down by the body and are showing up on scans up to ten years later. Since there is nothing tethering them in place they, like all other liquids, end up moving around. This is most easily seen in people who frequently get derma fillers where their face starts rounding up, they get a shelve on their top lip or a build up under the eyes (tear trough fillers).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MRI scans show that, for example, lip filler isn&amp;#39;t breaking down but rather moving upwards towards the nose and downwards to the chin. This gives the illusion that the filler has broken down and people go back to get another injection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a good and scientific breakdown of this I highly recommend checking out the Victorian Cosmetic Institute on YT where DR. Gavin Chan goes over the above in detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clean your lint screen after every load. Clean your lint trap, and dryer vent line once a year. If you notice your dryer taking longer to dry clothes, but it still gets hot, you likely have a buildup of highly flammable lint in the system somewhere that is having tons of hot air pumped through it every load of laundry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You do NOT want to have your dryer ignite 45 minutes into an hour long cycle, long after you&amp;#39;ve forgotten about it. By the time you notice it might be too late to control the fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dentistry, especially in the US and Canada, is a huge money-making industry. Unnecessary dental procedures are by far the most common and most costly of all dental scams. According to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smilecaredental.ca/blog/dentist-scams-and-unnecessary-dental-treatment&quot;&gt;reputable Canadian dentist&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;quot;Any person who learns how to avoid unnecessary dental procedures will save more than 50% on dental costs over their lifetime!&amp;quot;... which is very concerning when you think about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My former dental office would constantly tell me that I required dental x-rays, denying that I had recently had them taken. Each time this would happen, I would get out my phone, take a look at the date I recorded for the last time I had them taken, look at the official American Dental Association recommendations, and prove to them that they&amp;#39;re just trying to scam me. It&amp;#39;s a shame that most people would take the dental office&amp;#39;s word and get exposed to unnecessary radiation while simultaneously wasting their money/dental insurance coverage for something they don&amp;#39;t need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, back to the wisdom teeth removal part...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, that same dental office now says that I will need wisdom teeth removal surgery. Since I couldn&amp;#39;t really trust my dentist in the first place, I wanted a second opinion on this recommendation. I went to my former orthodontist, who just so happens to be one of the most reputable in my city, where I got my braces from when I was younger. She just laughed, saying that my wisdom teeth do not need removing whatsoever, confirming my skepticism with my dentist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The orthodontist also explained that dentists, especially in Canada and the US, will try to pressure you into a wisdom teeth removal surgery that you don&amp;#39;t really need since they get a sort of &amp;quot;referral bonus&amp;quot; from the dental surgeon each time one of their patients is referred to get a surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about how terrible and uncalled for this is... the risks involved with anesthesia, the cost of the procedure for the patients, the risk of a failed procedure, the stress it puts on the patients, and the list goes on. All of this so that dentists can make some extra $.&lt;/p&gt;

When it bonds to your brain receptors, it slows down the communication between neurons.  Sleep is the body and brain&amp;#39;s way of recharging and cleaning out adenosine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caffeine just so happens to bond to the same receptors that adenosine does.  However, unlike adenosine, neuron communication is not hindered.  This is why caffeine seemingly gives you brain energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For coffee to begin to affect you, it needs at least 20 minutes from the moment of consumption to when it finally hits your brain.  A quick 20 to 30 minute nap is also still significant enough to clean out some of the adenosine in your brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a Coffee Nap, as it&amp;#39;s referred to, both of the beneficial processes occur at once.  Adenosine is cleaned up from the brain, while the caffeine from coffee replaces the adenosine&amp;#39;s spot on your brain receptors.  Thus, when you wake up, you&amp;#39;re way more energized and alert than if you had chosen to do one of the two activities.&lt;/p&gt;

You&amp;#39;ve been in your tub for a bit too long staring at your phone, and when you finally decide to stand up and get out, your muscles are not used to the greater weight of your legs, and you can potentially slip and hurt yourself. Same with the arms.
The reason is not because your skin somehow gets soaked in water and weights more, like I thought for a long time.
The reason is because the water&amp;#39;s heats dilates your blood vessels, and more blood can circulate in your limbs. This helps alleviate sore muscles and such because the blood can heal them much quicker with increased access.
Be aware that the increased blood flow will come mainly from your brain and heart, which in turn makes your weaker and slower, therefore much more prone to accidents.
Always make sure to assess the weight and hold to some firm surface when you&amp;#39;re standing up.
Cheers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently posted a photo of my child and his prosthetics (it ended up being deleted but here’s the pic: &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/a/jd3WxAB&quot;&gt;https://imgur.com/a/jd3WxAB&lt;/a&gt; ) I was asked countless times how we afforded 5 pairs of prosthetics for our child who is only 5 years old and honestly? We have not paid one dime for his team of specialists. When he was first born, we were dirt poor. We were just a couple kids who suddenly had a disabled child and it was terrifying. Thankfully we had a pediatrician who wrote a referral to the Shriners and our sons entire future opened up. We lived 6 hours from the closest hospital but they had volunteers (known as Shriners) pick us up and take us to the doctor appointment and then drive us home the same day. If you keep your receipts for the food you buy on the way, they will reimburse you. If you live too far to make a trip in on day, they will pay for your hotel. They really just want to help children and that’s why you should know about them!!! Now that my husband and I are more well off, we don’t request assistance for anything but the actual medical bills. They pay 100%, even if you don’t have insurance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps someone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My sources are as follows:  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.healthyplace.com/neurodevelopmental-disorders/intellectual-disability/mild-moderate-severe-intellectual-disability-differences&quot;&gt;Mild, Moderate, Severe Learning Disability Differences | HealthyPlace&lt;/a&gt; ;   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.readandspell.com/types-of-learning-difficulties#what-is-a-learning-difficulty?&quot;&gt;5 Types of learning difficulties and how to help (readandspell.com)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning disabilities (aka Intellectual disabilities)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason learning disabilities are referred to as also intellectual disabilities is because IQ is a component in diagnosis (you can&amp;#39;t have an IQ of 90+ to have one), as well as the ability to learn and apply  conceptual, social, and practical life skills. Below is a table where I explain the criteria for the four different levels of learning disabilities someone can have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Type of Learning/Intellectual disabiltity&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Diagnostic criteria&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Mild Intellectual disability&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;IQ 50 to 70; Slower than typical in all developmental areas; No unusual physical characteristics; Able to learn practical life skills; Attains reading and math skills up to grade levels 3 to 6; Able to blend in socially; Functions in daily life&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Moderate Intellectual disability&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;IQ 35 to 49; Noticeable developmental delays (i.e. speech, motor skills); May have physical signs of impairment (i.e. thick tongue); Can communicate in basic, simple ways; Able to learn basic health and safety skills; Can complete self-care activities; Can travel alone to nearby, familiar places&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Severe Intellectual disability&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;IQ 20 to 34; Considerable delays in development; Understands speech, but little ability to communicate; Able to learn daily routines; May learn very simple self-care; Needs direct supervision in social situations&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Profound Intellectual disability&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;IQ less than 20; Significant developmental delays in all areas; Obvious physical and congenital abnormalities; Requires close supervision; Requires attendant to help in self-care activities; May respond to physical and social activities; Not capable of independent living&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning difficulties&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A learning difficulty is a condition that can cause an individual to experience problems in a traditional classroom learning context. It may interfere with literacy skills development and math/maths and can also affect memory, ability to focus and organizational skills. No two individuals with a learning difficulty are exactly alike and many conditions, such as dyslexia, attention deficit hyperactive disorder, dyscalculia, and dysgraphia, exist on a wide-spectrum. To be diagnosed, you must have specific issues that do not correlate with what would be expected of your overall IQ. See my table below to learn about the most common learning difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Types of learning difficulties&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Definitions&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Dyslexia&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Individuals who struggle with dyslexia can have issues with reading, writing or spelling or any combination of them.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Dyscalculia&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Individuals who struggle with dyscalculia have difficulty with processing numbers, whether that be basic arithmetic, deciding the approach to take on a mathematical problem, sequencing numbers and understanding spatial reasoning.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Dysgraphia&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Individuals who struggle with dysgraphia have a hard time with writing and may produce text that is illegible&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;ADHD&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;There are three types of ADHD (ADHD-Primarily Inattentive; ADHD-Primarily Hyperactive/Impulsive; and ADHD-Combined Presentation).&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Dyspraxia&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;A motor-skills difficulty that can affect a learner’s ability to write by hand, and may impact on planning skills&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know how useful this could be for anyone, but as someone with dyscalculia, Asperger&amp;#39;s (Autism) and ADHD-Combined Presentation, I get really frustrated when people call my difficulties by the wrong name!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t unilaterally indemnify yourself for damages to the public; a potential damaged party has to relieve you voluntarily as consideration for some reciprocal transaction.

&lt;p&gt;Why YSK: Too many people allow themselves to be misled and intimidated into waiving their legal rights. The ony person who can tell you what your rights are is your lawyer.

They can also have long-lasting side effects, so don&amp;#39;t freak out if you have had effects for months after stopping, because they could still go away. But do see a urologist or endocrinologist, or other specialized doctor, who you know knows about PSSD. That way they can help figure out what is wrong with you and what the next steps are. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, YSK: that doctors and psychiatrists are specialists in their own field. Most psychiatrists do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; specialize in therapy. What this means is there may be therapy options for your disorder which you may be unaware of. For instance many psychiatrists (as opposed to psychologists) will prescribe SSRIs for OCD, and not ask whether the patient is doing exposure therapy (which is the golden standard for OCD treatment). This is to no fault of their own; it is just outside of their speciality which is to know about &lt;em&gt;medication&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why YSK: Talk over your different health options with a doctor or second opinion if you believe you are being prescribed medication that does not fit your needs. However NEVER stop a medication without medical supervision, that can be extremely dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

This is because using the words &amp;quot;raped&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;murdered&amp;quot; is tantamount to a public accusation. If the accused is later found not guilty in court, then they could sue the news organisation for libel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why after someone is found guilty, then you start seeing those words on the news, because they are now legally judged to have committed that offence, and it&amp;#39;s not libel to state the fact anymore. But using those words before they&amp;#39;re found guilty is legally risky.&lt;/p&gt;

Save yourself the hassle of filing a claim and having to get a new card by remembering this the next time you make a purchase at your favorite spot or when you see a transaction at an ATM pop up that you may not recognize and you&amp;#39;ve shopped at a dispensary recently :)&lt;/p&gt;
