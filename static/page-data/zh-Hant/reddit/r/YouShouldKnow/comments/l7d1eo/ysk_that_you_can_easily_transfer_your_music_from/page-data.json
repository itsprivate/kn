I personally switched to Tidal but the process explained below works for most (if not all) music streaming services and even more.</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Export &quot;Service-to-Service:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I personally used <a href=\"https://soundiiz.com/\">Soundiiz</a> , because I used it in the past, to export everything in one go. It&#39;s free for a single playlist and up to 200 tracks but full export service-to-service if you pay for their service (subscription). </p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Export to text file (.csv):</strong></p>\n\n<p>I exported as .csv all my playlists and tracks using <a href=\"https://github.com/watsonbox/exportify\">Exportify</a> ,  <a href=\"https://watsonbox.github.io/exportify/\">(github)</a> . This includes the Spotify URI and other details such as disc number and track number. If you don&#39;t know what a .csv is just know that you can open it with Excel (or Calc if you&#39;re using Libre Office).</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Podcasts?:</strong></p>\n\n<p>There are plenty alternatives, many more suited to podcast listening and discovery. I am looking into podcast apps so here&#39;s a list for that too https:/ /<a href=\"http://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2020/07/07/best-free-podcast-apps/\">www.digitalmusicnews.com/2020/07/07/best-free-podcast-apps/</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Hope it helps!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/l7d1eo/ysk_that_you_can_easily_transfer_your_music_from/","title":"YSK that you can easily transfer your music from one streaming service to another and even to text files","tags":["YouShouldKnow","reddit"],"date":"February 02, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-02T23:33:08.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-02 23:33","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"eed165c9-753d-59b8-8416-f4e99b817cdd","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/l7d1eo/ysk_that_you_can_easily_transfer_your_music_from/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/l7d1eo/ysk_that_you_can_easily_transfer_your_music_from/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"YouShouldKnow","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow","author":"MAD623","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/MAD623","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"MAD623","score":54,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"YSK，您可以轻松地将您的音乐从一个流媒体服务传输到另一个，甚至文本文件。","the_new_excerpt":"为什么是YSK：基于最近Spotify获得了一项专利，可以监控\n语气\n[https://consequenceofsound.net/2021/01/spotify-patent-monitor-users-speech/]。\n你可能会发现你自己的情况，你想切换到一个不同的\n流媒体服务或备份您的音乐播放列表。\n\n作为...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"YSK，您可以輕鬆地將您的音樂從一個流媒體服務傳輸到另一個，甚至文本文件。","the_new_excerpt":"爲什麼是YSK：基於最近Spotify獲得了一項專利，可以監控\n語氣\n[https://consequenceofsound.net/2021/01/spotify-patent-monitor-users-speech/]。\n你可能會發現你自己的情況，你想切換到一個不同的\n流媒體服務或備份您的音樂播放列表。\n\n作爲...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-1daa363c-b28c-5a47-ac5d-26895fdafb50","excerpt":"YSK: Jehovah’s witnesses are collecting your data and you can stop them\n\nWhy YSK: It’s an invasion of privacy and you can make it harder for them to send\nyou unwanted mail and call you\n\nI’m a former witness and after I left certain people have tried finding out my\naddress and other personal…","slug":"/reddit/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/l6l9b1/ysk_jehovahs_witnesses_are_collecting_your_data/","title":"YSK: Jehovah’s witnesses are collecting your data and you can stop them","date":"February 02, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"耶和华见证人正在收集你的数据，你可以阻止他们。","the_new_excerpt":"耶和华见证人正在收集你的数据，你可以阻止他们。\n\n为什么YSK：这是对隐私的侵犯，你可以让他们更难发送。\n你的不速之客，给你打电话\n\n我是一个前证人，在我离开后，某些人试图找出我的...\n地址和其他个人...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"耶和華見證人正在收集你的數據，你可以阻止他們。","the_new_excerpt":"耶和華見證人正在收集你的數據，你可以阻止他們。\n\n爲什麼YSK：這是對隱私的侵犯，你可以讓他們更難發送。\n你的不速之客，給你打電話\n\n我是一個前證人，在我離開後，某些人試圖找出我的...\n地址和其他個人...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-0d5bd118-ab1a-5b4c-8c9d-afdbdee1bf8f","excerpt":"Obligatory disclaimer - I am in the US and this is based on my experience, but\nI'm sure its similar in other countries.
