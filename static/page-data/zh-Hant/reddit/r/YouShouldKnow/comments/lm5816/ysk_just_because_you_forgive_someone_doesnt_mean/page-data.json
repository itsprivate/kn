Some people expect that as their preordained right and some even bother to apologize. <strong>To be let &quot;back into&quot; your life is not a given.</strong>  Just because you are able to get past other people&#39;s crappy and hurtful behavior doesn&#39;t mean that they automatically regain the privilege of being included in your life.
