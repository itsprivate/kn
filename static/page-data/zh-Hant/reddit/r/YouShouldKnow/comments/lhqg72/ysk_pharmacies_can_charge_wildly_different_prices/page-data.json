For many years, we were paying $600 / month out of pocket at our regular pharmacy - even though we are lucky enough to have very good insurance. We just assumed all pharmacies would charge roughly the same price based on insurance. A co-worker suggested to try her pharmacy clear across town - she promised they could save us money. We called them up and to our complete astonishment, the medication was absolutely, 100% free of charge. We have now been getting it free for a few years, and it still blows my mind every month when the medicine is mailed to our home completely free. It pays to shop around - I wish someone had told me that sooner.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/lhqg72/ysk_pharmacies_can_charge_wildly_different_prices/","title":"YSK: Pharmacies can charge wildly different prices for the same medication.
