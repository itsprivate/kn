Being able to predict what is about to happen or what could possibly happen could help you avoid being part of or causing a very dangerous accident. If you see that the car in front of you is on ice, slow down GRADUALLY (gives cars behind you time to react) and don&#39;t turn your wheel suddenly as you can easily lose traction doing so.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: As some comments point out here, the most important thing is to be safe and keep your distance from other cars (minimum 4 seconds travel time AT SAFE SPEEDS on highways). Maintain slower speeds than normal, keep lane switching to a minimum and keep your headlights on! If you&#39;re completely uncertain about your traction turn your hazards on to signal caution to other drivers.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/layr4p/ysk_that_when_driving_on_wet_winter_roads_that/","title":"YSK that when driving on wet winter roads, that when a car in front of you stops producing (or greatly reduces) its spray behind the rear tires that this means they are driving on ice.","tags":["YouShouldKnow","reddit"],"date":"February 03, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-03T07:27:56.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-03 07:27","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"layr4p","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/layr4p/ysk_that_when_driving_on_wet_winter_roads_that/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/layr4p/ysk_that_when_driving_on_wet_winter_roads_that/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"YouShouldKnow","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow","author":"GanjaFett_420","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/GanjaFett_420","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"GanjaFett_420","score":19563,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"YSK说，当在潮湿的冬季道路上行驶时，当你前面的一辆车停止产生（或大大减少）其后轮胎后面的喷雾时，这意味着他们正在冰上行驶。","the_new_excerpt":"为什么 YSK: 你应该知道这一点，因为控制你的速度和意识到你的速度。\n其他车辆的速度和运动是非常重要的方面。\n在恶劣天气和/或冰雪路面上驾驶。能够预测什么是\n即将发生或可能发生的事情可以帮助你... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"YSK說，當在潮溼的冬季道路上行駛時，當你前面的一輛車停止產生（或大大減少）其後輪胎後面的噴霧時，這意味着他們正在冰上行駛。","the_new_excerpt":"爲什麼 YSK: 你應該知道這一點，因爲控制你的速度和意識到你的速度。\n其他車輛的速度和運動是非常重要的方面。\n在惡劣天氣和/或冰雪路面上駕駛。能夠預測什麼是\n即將發生或可能發生的事情可以幫助你... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-l5teob","excerpt":"Obligatory disclaimer - I am in the US and this is based on my experience, but\nI'm sure its similar in other countries.
