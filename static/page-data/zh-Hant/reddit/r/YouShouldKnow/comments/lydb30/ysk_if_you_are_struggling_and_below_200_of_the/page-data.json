Having access to a solid computer for school / work purposes can be challenging. A lot of schools went online recently, and people living in underserved communities struggled to provide adequate technology for their child to access their coursework. In addition, having access to a computer would allow those unemployed as a result of the recent global issues to seek employment opportunities from home.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://pcsforpeople.org/\">pcsforpeople.org</a> has been around since 1998. They offer computer solutions (tower, monitor, keyboard, mouse, etc.) from $0 - $160. You have to provide income verification to prove you are struggling.</p>\n\n<p>[EDIT] They also offer affordable internet access for those that need it. It&#39;s $180 a year for high speed internet with no data cap. </p>\n\n<p>[EDIT 2] Given the amount of people that have asked this question, yes, it is for America only. </p>\n\n<p>I know what I typed probably reads incoherently.
