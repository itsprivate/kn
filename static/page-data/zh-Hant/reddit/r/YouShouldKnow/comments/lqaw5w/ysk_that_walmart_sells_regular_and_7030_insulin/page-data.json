Here are a few points:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>For those who are truly insulin dependent, this is critical information. I&#39;ve seen many people show up to my ED in DKA or HHS because they could not afford insulin. Many were already prescribed a regular + NPH regimen and did not know walmart sold it cheaper. </p></li>\n<li><p>If you already take a regular, NPH, or 70/30 insulin regimen, there should be no risk as this is the same medication made by Novo Nordisk sold under a different brand name</p></li>\n<li><p>It is true that regular insulin (short acting) is not interchangeable with rapid acting (like lispro). You should only substitute under the direction of your healthcare provider. Call or secure chat message your doctor&#39;s office. Usually they will respond quickly with a message from the doctor or a practice nurse. If it&#39;s after their business hours and you need insulin, you NEED INSULIN. This is a safe, effective medication for those who need it. Ask the licensed pharmacist at the Walmart pharmacy for guidance on how to take it until your doctor can call you back. That&#39;s what they&#39;re there for. </p></li>\n<li><p>Pasted below is an article from the Tulane school of medicine on the onset, peak, and duration times of various insulins. As you can see, regular insulin is slower to reach its peak and acts longer, so there&#39;s a higher risk of &quot;stacking insulins,&quot; and having an unpredictable reaction. Talk to your provider or pharmacist and mind the timing of your insulin administration and meals. \n<a href=\"https://tmedweb.tulane.edu/pharmwiki/doku.php/insulin_regimens\">https://tmedweb.tulane.edu/pharmwiki/doku.php/insulin_regimens</a></p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Thank you for the awards. Hopefully the information helps someone out there.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/lqaw5w/ysk_that_walmart_sells_regular_and_7030_insulin/","title":"YSK that Walmart sells regular and 70/30 insulin vials for $24.88 and $42.88 apiece over the counter.
