This was hounded into me from a young age growing up where we get a lot of snow every year, but it occurred to me that it may not be common knowledge in Texas. Stay safe out there, everyone!</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I’m getting a shocking amount of angry people in the comments claiming that this isn’t true. It’s a real thing that’s on the news every single winter where I live. Here are some news stories: </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wbur.org/cognoscenti/2013/02/15/carbon-monoxide-darshak-sanghavi\">https://www.wbur.org/cognoscenti/2013/02/15/carbon-monoxide-darshak-sanghavi</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbc.ca/amp/1.4966337\">https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbc.ca/amp/1.4966337</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/carbon-monoxide-poisoning/71433/\">https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/carbon-monoxide-poisoning/71433/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://people.com/celebrity/mom-infant-son-killed-by-carbon-monoxide-from-snow-stuck-in-tailpipe/\">https://people.com/celebrity/mom-infant-son-killed-by-carbon-monoxide-from-snow-stuck-in-tailpipe/</a></p>\n\n<p>This is the result of a 5 minute google. I’m not sure why some people are so angry with me over this, but I’m just trying to be helpful and spread awareness.
