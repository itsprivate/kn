For some fish like the common goldfish, this is important because they can get up to a foot. Cramming them in a small space means there body grows while their organs don&#39;t. Also for other fish like bettas, it just doesn&#39;t feel right confining them to such a small space. This mean, while a goldfish lives for 10-20 years with GOOD care, you&#39;d be lucky to have one live for 2 years.</p>\n\n<p>Next is because of ammonia nitrite and nitrate and a lack of a filter. You have filters in fish tank for two main reasons. 1. is to agitate the water. 2. Is to grow beneficial bacteria. \nYou may wonder, what is beneficial bacteria? It is a type of bacteria that consumes ammonia, a common toxin in a fishes poop. Then it turns it into nitrite which is just as harmful.  Then finally, it converts it to nitrate which is much less harmful. Even having a tiny filter doesn&#39;t fix most stuff,  because some fish like goldfish produce a CRAP ton of waste and the bacteria can&#39;t keep up. Also some fish like bettas are tropical fish and most bowls don&#39;t have a filter. Most bettas that live in bowls don&#39;t last more than 6 months.</p>\n\n<p>Finally bowls are bad because if the surface area. Even with a filter, the surface area doesn&#39;t allow the bowl to oxygenate which is bad for the fish.</p>\n\n<p>I say &quot;almost all&quot; because if you were too keep a 10 gallon bowl with cherry shrimp that&#39;s filtered and heater and has a lot of plants that would be ok. Even though the tank size for a betta is 5 Gallons, a bowl of 5 gallons just doesn&#39;t have enough surface area. </p>\n\n<p>I could go on and on and on but I will keep this a short as possible.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/macbux/ysk_almost_all_fishbowls_are_cruel_and_inhumane/","title":"YSK (almost all) fishbowls are cruel and inhumane","tags":["YouShouldKnow","reddit"],"date":"March 22, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-22T18:58:00.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-22 18:58","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"3e63de76-5689-5c4e-a828-4baf954ce460","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/macbux/ysk_almost_all_fishbowls_are_cruel_and_inhumane/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/macbux/ysk_almost_all_fishbowls_are_cruel_and_inhumane/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"YouShouldKnow","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow","author":"pokemonvsavengers","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/pokemonvsavengers","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"pokemonvsavengers","score":74,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"YSK(几乎所有)的鱼缸都是残忍和不人道的。","the_new_excerpt":"你应该知道鱼缸是残忍的，不人道的，为什么YSK知道这是\n因为很多原因。\n\n首先是鱼缸的面积。对于一些鱼类来说，比如常见的金鱼，这就是\n重要，因为它们可以达到一尺。把它们挤在一个小空间里\n意味着他们的身体在成长，而他们的器官... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"YSK(幾乎所有)的魚缸都是殘忍和不人道的。","the_new_excerpt":"你應該知道魚缸是殘忍的，不人道的，爲什麼YSK知道這是\n因爲很多原因。\n\n首先是魚缸的面積。對於一些魚類來說，比如常見的金魚，這就是\n重要，因爲它們可以達到一尺。把它們擠在一個小空間裏\n意味着他們的身體在成長，而他們的器官... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-aeca407b-5019-5cd5-a797-9c2b0ca76965","excerpt":"Why YSK: (US Only) The program is a partnership between the IRS and popular tax\nfiling software's like TurboTax, TaxSlayer, TaxAct, etc... that allows you to\nfile your entire return for free if you make less than the $72,000 AGI cutoff.\n\nHere's the link to IRS Free…","slug":"/reddit/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/mafb13/ysk_if_you_make_less_than_72000_a_year_adjusted/","title":"YSK: If you make less than $72,000 a year adjusted gross income (AGI) you can file taxes completely free with the IRS Free File program","date":"March 22, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"YSK: 如果你每年的调整后总收入（AGI）低于72,000美元，你可以通过IRS免费报税计划完全免费报税。","the_new_excerpt":"为什么选择YSK：（仅限美国）该计划是美国国税局和流行的税务部门之间的合作项目。\n报税软件如TurboTax, TaxSlayer, TaxAct等......可以让你\n如果你的收入低于72,000美元的AGI截止值，你就可以免费提交整个申报。\n\n这里的链接到国税局免费... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"YSK: 如果你每年的調整後總收入（AGI）低於72,000美元，你可以通過IRS免費報稅計劃完全免費報稅。","the_new_excerpt":"爲什麼選擇YSK：（僅限美國）該計劃是美國國稅局和流行的稅務部門之間的合作項目。\n報稅軟件如TurboTax, TaxSlayer, TaxAct等......可以讓你\n如果你的收入低於72,000美元的AGI截止值，你就可以免費提交整個申報。\n\n這裏的鏈接到國稅局免費... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-92300f19-2f99-513e-875c-3b693d256ef5","excerpt":"Why YSK: I just got a massage and they found the source of my chronic pain,\nwhich were knots in my muscles from lifting weights.
