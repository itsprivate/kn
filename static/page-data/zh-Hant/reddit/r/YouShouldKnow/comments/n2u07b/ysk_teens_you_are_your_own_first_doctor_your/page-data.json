If you have problems with health (chronic pains, seemingly uncommon body changes, problems with focus, trouble hearing/smelling etc). Whatever symptoms that seem to affect you significantly more than your peers - bring them up to your parents.</p>\n\n<p>I have had so many serious issues growing up that should have been looked at:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>inability to breath through nose when running, unlike my peers (never told)</li>\n<li>gynecomastia (shameful topic, never looked into due to lack of knowledge)</li>\n<li>severe ADHD symptoms (dismissed as &quot;part of my personality&quot;)</li>\n<li>rarely I&#39;d get very sharp pain in my prostate when I sneeze (never told)</li>\n<li>i&#39;d get strong pain in my nasopharynx whenever I&#39;d get a cold (never told)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These are just some examples. I know some teens have sever acne issues. Some have puberty delay or menstrual cycle issues, etc. Often parents wouldn&#39;t treat their kids for 2 reasons:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>because these problems seem &quot;normal&quot;, since they develop so gradually, they kind of end up accepting them as &quot;oh this is how my kid is&quot;</li>\n<li>because kids don&#39;t tell their parents about their health issues, so they aren&#39;t even aware</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Take a moment and think about all the &quot;weird traits&quot; that you have (like gynecomastia was for me for example) or pains that aren&#39;t normal and write it down, then talk to parents about them, see if they can help you treat those (if it ends up being something simple) or go to a doctor.</p>\n\n<p>Also, parents - ask your kids about this, do overall &quot;therapist check-up&quot; kind of talk with them once in a while.</p>\n\n<p>____________________</p>\n\n<p>Even with the obvious health conditions like bacterial intenstinal infection, even in young kids, parents usually don&#39;t take the kids to the doctor, unless the kid gets a fever and there is blood in the stool: <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21087537/\">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21087537/</a></p>\n\n<p>___________________</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Depression is one of the leading causes of illness and disability among adolescents, and suicide is the third leading cause of death in people aged 15–19 years. Mental health conditions account for 16% of the global burden of disease and injury in people aged 10–19 years. <strong>Half of all mental health disorders in adulthood start by age 14, but most cases are undetected and untreated.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Many factors have an impact on the well-being and mental health of adolescents. Violence, poverty, stigma, exclusion, and living in humanitarian and fragile settings can increase the risk of developing mental health problems. <strong>The consequences of not addressing adolescent mental health conditions extend to adulthood, impairing both physical and mental health and limiting opportunities to lead fulfilling lives as adults.</strong>&quot;: <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/adolescents-health-risks-and-solutions\">https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/adolescents-health-risks-and-solutions</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Why YSK:</strong>  cause you can live misearble life in your childhood, teens and early adulthood until your finally start taking care of your health and realize that many things should have been treated long ago, especially those that affect QoL a lot (and can mess up your forming years and give you mental health issues).</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/n2u07b/ysk_teens_you_are_your_own_first_doctor_your/","title":"YSK Teens, you are your own first doctor!
