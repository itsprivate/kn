The new Colorado law makes it clear that you may not ask for previous pay information from a prospective employee during things like an interview process. </p>\n\n<p>You now have better transparency as a worker in Colorado and the people you work with now can only be payed more than you based on experience or merit not how much the manager likes them, their skin color, or sexual identity and/or orientation. </p>\n\n<p>Sources: \n<a href=\"https://www.denverpost.com/2021/01/01/colorado-laws-businesses-employers-workers-2021/\">https://www.denverpost.com/2021/01/01/colorado-laws-businesses-employers-workers-2021/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb19-085\">https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb19-085</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mercer.com/our-thinking/law-and-policy-group/colorado-new-pay-equity-law-takes-effect.html\">https://www.mercer.com/our-thinking/law-and-policy-group/colorado-new-pay-equity-law-takes-effect.html</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/lozk0a/ysk_if_you_are_an_employer_or_employee_in/","title":"YSK If you are an Employer or Employee in Colorado, a Job Posting MUST disclose pay and benefits.","tags":["YouShouldKnow","reddit"],"date":"February 22, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-22T19:39:31.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-22 19:39","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"e1a5ae4d-f774-5ac3-98bb-c5fc635460d6","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/lozk0a/ysk_if_you_are_an_employer_or_employee_in/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/lozk0a/ysk_if_you_are_an_employer_or_employee_in/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"YouShouldKnow","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow","author":"SamL214","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/SamL214","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"SamL214","score":95,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"YSK 如果你是科罗拉多州的雇主或雇员，招聘信息必须披露薪酬和福利。","the_new_excerpt":"为什么选择YSK。\n\n从2021年1月1日起，《同工同酬法》要求雇主：\n在发布招聘信息时披露薪酬和福利。\n\n作为一名员工（或求职者）。\n\n这意味着你现在可以看到新员工的薪酬。\n\n你的雇主还必须披露任何晋升......","locale":"zh"},{"title":"YSK 如果你是科羅拉多州的僱主或僱員，招聘信息必須披露薪酬和福利。","the_new_excerpt":"爲什麼選擇YSK。\n\n從2021年1月1日起，《同工同酬法》要求僱主：\n在發佈招聘信息時披露薪酬和福利。\n\n作爲一名員工（或求職者）。\n\n這意味着你現在可以看到新員工的薪酬。\n\n你的僱主還必須披露任何晉升......","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-c09f9f1a-3d9e-5a60-8caf-25ae2e0912b3","excerpt":"Why YSK - It is called the “kill zone” and its supposed to act as a buffer zone\nbetween a car and the truck.
