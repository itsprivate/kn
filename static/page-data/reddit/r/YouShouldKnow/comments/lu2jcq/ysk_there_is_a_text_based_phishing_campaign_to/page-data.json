They ask you to follow a link that looks like it&#39;s Venmo&#39;s and sign in.  The link uses &quot;venmo&quot; as its third level domain so it appears legit, but the second level domain is something else meaning any sign in information is NOT going to venmo, but a scammer who will then access and drain your account.</p>\n\n<p>Venmo will not send you texts asking you to sign in.  NO BANK WILL.  Instead, any legitimate fraud alert will ask you to sign in to their app/website <strong>without</strong> providing the link.  This scam exists solely to trick people into &quot;logging in&quot; on the fake website and stealing your credentials.</p>\n\n<p>Do not fall for this scam.  Report it if you happen to get this specific text, and remember NEVER to sign in on any links delivered to you (unrequested).</p>\n\n<p>Also, remember that third level domains have no relation to the company.  All websites follow the {xxxx}.{yyyyy}.{zzzzz} format.  {yyyyy} tells you the domain (in the sense most people think about it).  {xxxxx} tells you where in the domain to look.  Therefore {Signup}.{Google}.{com} is Google but {Google}.{Signup}.{com} is someone called &quot;Signup&quot; pretending to be google.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/lu2jcq/ysk_there_is_a_text_based_phishing_campaign_to/","title":"YSK there is a text based phishing campaign to hack people's venmos.
