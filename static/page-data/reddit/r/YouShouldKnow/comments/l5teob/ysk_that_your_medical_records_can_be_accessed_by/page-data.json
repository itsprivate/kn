The US has very strict HIPAA laws that protect any info we share with a Dr and our medical records.</em></p>\n\n<p>--</p>\n\n<p>I was glad when medical records went online. Easy to access all my Dr&#39;s visits, instant alerts for labs, and no more calling in or waiting on the mail for bills! However my mind changed when I recently applied for Executive Life Insurance.</p>\n\n<p>The process was thorough, meaning not only did I fill out a lot of forms and take a lot of tests, they also checked my medical history to make sure I wasn&#39;t lying. I had to sign a waiver saying they could access all my medical records - figured it was just ER visits and major diagnosis (cancer, depression, etc).</p>\n\n<p>What I found out was shocking - here are some examples of questions they asked me after my EHR&#39;s (Electronic Health Records) were analyzed by them:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>&quot;Why did you put you&#39;re not a drug user when your Dr&#39;s notes in 2010 said you smoked marijuana?&quot; <em>(I smoked a little in college, but not anymore)</em></li>\n<li>&quot;Why did you put you don&#39;t suffer from anxiety/depression when you were prescribed Xanax in 2015?&quot; <em>(I had some dental work done, and the Dentist literally prescribed me 1 pill to ease the anxiety before the appointment)</em></li>\n<li>&quot;Why did you say you don&#39;t suffer from anxiety/depression when you went to a therapist in 2016?&quot; <em>(I had some big changes in my life that I needed help with)</em></li>\n<li>&quot;Why did you say you&#39;ve never had any heart issues when you had an EKG in 2018?&quot; <em>(This was part of a normal health screening)</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>--</p>\n\n<p>Why YSK: They had ALL my records - Lab Tests, Prescription Fills, Diagnosis&#39;, Insurance...and scariest, personal Dr&#39;s Notes. And it all came from a single aggregator&#39;s database, who collected it from all my Dr&#39;s (Medical, Dental, Vision, and Mental), Hospitals, Labs and Pharmacies.</p>\n\n<p>And just remember, if they can get access to it, so can hackers. This will make me second guess what I tell the Dr during future visits, which is incredibly sad and dangerous for overall health.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/l5teob/ysk_that_your_medical_records_can_be_accessed_by/","title":"YSK That your Medical Records can be accessed by others electronically and reveal a lot more about you than you think","tags":["YouShouldKnow","reddit"],"date":"February 03, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-03T02:15:03.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-03 02:15","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"l5teob","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/l5teob/ysk_that_your_medical_records_can_be_accessed_by/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/l5teob/ysk_that_your_medical_records_can_be_accessed_by/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"YouShouldKnow","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow","author":"teknoprep","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/teknoprep","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"teknoprep","score":51,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"YSK，您的医疗记录可以被他人以电子方式访问，并透露出比您想象中更多的信息。","the_new_excerpt":"义务声明--我在美国，这是我的经验之谈，但...。\n我相信在其他国家也有类似的情况。美国有非常严格的HIPAA法律。\n保护我们与医生分享的任何信息和我们的医疗记录。\n\n--\n\n我很高兴当医疗记录上网。很容易访问我所有医生的...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"YSK，您的醫療記錄可以被他人以電子方式訪問，並透露出比您想象中更多的信息。","the_new_excerpt":"義務聲明--我在美國，這是我的經驗之談，但...。\n我相信在其他國家也有類似的情況。美國有非常嚴格的HIPAA法律。\n保護我們與醫生分享的任何信息和我們的醫療記錄。\n\n--\n\n我很高興當醫療記錄上網。很容易訪問我所有醫生的...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-l7d1eo","excerpt":"Why YSK: Based on the recent news that Spotify secured a patent to monitor\nusers' speech\n[https://consequenceofsound.net/2021/01/spotify-patent-monitor-users-speech/],\nyou may find yourself in the situation that you want to switch to a different\nstreaming service or back-up your music playlists.\n\nAs…","slug":"/reddit/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/l7d1eo/ysk_that_you_can_easily_transfer_your_music_from/","title":"YSK that you can easily transfer your music from one streaming service to another and even to text files","date":"February 02, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"YSK，您可以轻松地将您的音乐从一个流媒体服务传输到另一个，甚至文本文件。","the_new_excerpt":"为什么是YSK：基于最近Spotify获得了一项专利，可以监控\n语气\n[https://consequenceofsound.net/2021/01/spotify-patent-monitor-users-speech/]。\n你可能会发现你自己的情况，你想切换到一个不同的\n流媒体服务或备份您的音乐播放列表。\n\n作为...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"YSK，您可以輕鬆地將您的音樂從一個流媒體服務傳輸到另一個，甚至文本文件。","the_new_excerpt":"爲什麼是YSK：基於最近Spotify獲得了一項專利，可以監控\n語氣\n[https://consequenceofsound.net/2021/01/spotify-patent-monitor-users-speech/]。\n你可能會發現你自己的情況，你想切換到一個不同的\n流媒體服務或備份您的音樂播放列表。\n\n作爲...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-layr4p","excerpt":"Why YSK: You should know this because controlling your speeds and being aware of\nother other vehicles speeds as well as movements are very important aspects of\ndriving in inclement weather and/or icy roads.
