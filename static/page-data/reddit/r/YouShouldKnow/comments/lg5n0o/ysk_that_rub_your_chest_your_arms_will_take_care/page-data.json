He is learning to fight on top of a frozen lake and ends up falling through the ice.

YSK that this is not genuine advice and is a made-up line for a movie. In the behind-the-scenes featurette, Christopher Nolan admits that this is false and mentions that he worries boy scouts across the world would take this advice as literal even though its complete nonsense. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/oMkmjg-qZRk?t=2450\">https://youtu.be/oMkmjg-qZRk?t=2450</a></p>\n\n<p>It is unlikely that you will be in a situation where you fall through some ice.
