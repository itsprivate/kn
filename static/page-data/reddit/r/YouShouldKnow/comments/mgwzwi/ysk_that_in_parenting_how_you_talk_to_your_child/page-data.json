Namely, that higher income parents teach their kids <em>more words,</em> and this then leads to better brain language development. Knowing about this misconception is important for many reasons, perhaps the most important being that the science-backed solution to helping grow your child’s brain development in this area is actually very simple and doable for <em>any parent, regardless of socioeconomic or educational background.</em> It has nothing to do with dumping fancy words at your kids.</p>\n\n<p>I’d safely assume that most parents know that talking - and teaching verbal communication - to their children from a young age is vital. But, there is a widespread misconception that parental income or education correlates to a child’s ability to develop strongly in this area. Notably, since research has shown that, on average, children from higher-income families hear millions <em>more words</em> during their first three years of life, somehow that means that such children are set up for better brain development than children from lower-income families. <strong>This actually isn’t true.</strong></p>\n\n<p>In 1995, a research study came out that found that children from higher-income families hear about <strong>30 million more words</strong> during their first three years of life than children from lower-income families.</p>\n\n<p>So was coined the phenomenon of the “<strong>30-million-word-gap</strong>”, at the time correlated with significant gaps in tests of vocabulary, language development, and reading comp skills of kids from lower vs higher income families as they matured. People ran with this idea. Claiming essentially that kids from higher income families, who on average heard and were taught so many more words, were somehow set up as they got older to have a more &quot;highly developed&quot; brain in terms of language capabilities.</p>\n\n<p>More recent science has debunked this correlation, pointing to a very different reality. MIT cognitive scientists have now discovered that <em>it is not the number of words</em> a parent says <strong>to</strong> their child that can change their brain (for the better), but instead <em>the nature of open-ended conversation</em> a parent encourages <strong>with</strong> their child.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Creating lots of opportunity for this kind of open-ended, back-and-forth conversation is actually more critical to brain and language development than the findings of the &quot;word gap&quot;.</strong> This research from MIT applied to children <em>regardless of parental income</em> <em>or education.</em> The finding suggests that <em>any</em> parent can have considerable influence over their child&#39;s language and brain development by simply engaging them in daily conversation where the child has space to drive the conversation and create conversation turns as they please. Encouraging turn-taking conversation, as opposed to one-sided conversation, can be implemented by any parent.</p>\n\n<p>The key finding from the aforementioned research is that parents should understand they should not just <em>talk to</em> their child, but instead should consistently <em>talk with</em> their child. Being interactive is what matters. Creating time and space for casual, story-oriented familial conversation, where there is less talking at or to your child by the parent and more talking with and listening to your child, changes children’s brains.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe using excessive flashcards and talking at our children with many words, probably just frustrating or confusing them, should be a thing of the past. Maybe the solution is really as simple as focusing on fun conversation that genuinely encourages children to participate. Not just listen and memorize.</p>\n\n<p>MIT study: <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797617742725\">https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797617742725</a></p>\n\n<p>1995 Word Gap study: <a href=\"https://www.aft.org/sites/default/files/periodicals/TheEarlyCatastrophe.pdf\">https://www.aft.org/sites/default/files/periodicals/TheEarlyCatastrophe.pdf</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/mgwzwi/ysk_that_in_parenting_how_you_talk_to_your_child/","title":"YSK that in parenting, HOW you talk to your child matters - it changes their brain.
