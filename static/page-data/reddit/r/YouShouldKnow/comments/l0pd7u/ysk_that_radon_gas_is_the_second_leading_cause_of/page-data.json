Anyway, it&#39;s not something you can sense yourself, it needs to be tested for. I learned that it comes from the soil beneath your home, and is estimated to be at high levels in up to 8 million American homes. I don&#39;t know a whole lot, and I&#39;m not a scientist, but I figured a $15 or so test is worth it for knowing to make changes if needed to prevent lung cancer. Tests can be found sold online. If I am getting something wrong, someone more knowledgeable please educate me, but I thought people should at least know to look into it if I am indeed correct.</p>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/radon/radon-frequently-asked-questions\">https://www.epa.gov/radon/radon-frequently-asked-questions</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/l0pd7u/ysk_that_radon_gas_is_the_second_leading_cause_of/","title":"YSK that radon gas is the second leading cause of lung cancer in the US, and finding out whether it is present in high levels in your home can be as simple as a cheap home testing kit.","tags":["YouShouldKnow","reddit"],"date":"January 22, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-22T19:33:49.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-22 19:33","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"00dac27a-a35e-5e59-9190-e559862e3528","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/l0pd7u/ysk_that_radon_gas_is_the_second_leading_cause_of/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/l0pd7u/ysk_that_radon_gas_is_the_second_leading_cause_of/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"YouShouldKnow","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow","author":"cosmicragdoll","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/cosmicragdoll","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"cosmicragdoll","score":68,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"YSK认为，氡气是美国肺癌的第二大原因，而找出家中是否存在高浓度的氡气，可以像一个廉价的家庭测试工具一样简单。","the_new_excerpt":"为什么是YSK。\n\nI didn't even know about radon gas until today, 但也有可能是我的生活 but it's possible I just live.\n在一块石头下。总之，这不是你自己能感觉到的，需要的是\n测试的。我了解到，它来自于你家下面的土壤，而且是\n估计在高达800万...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"YSK認爲，氡氣是美國肺癌的第二大原因，而找出家中是否存在高濃度的氡氣，可以像一個廉價的家庭測試工具一樣簡單。","the_new_excerpt":"爲什麼是YSK。\n\nI didn't even know about radon gas until today, 但也有可能是我的生活 but it's possible I just live.\n在一塊石頭下。總之，這不是你自己能感覺到的，需要的是\n測試的。我瞭解到，它來自於你家下面的土壤，而且是\n估計在高達800萬...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-e48586c3-a678-58c4-8cac-a05a3f3d4d80","excerpt":"This is something that isn't limited to a single gender or age group; people\nacross the world do it.\n\nIf you notice that every time you speak one-on-one with a person, they have\nnegative or salacious things to say about your mutual friends (or even people\nyou've never met!), that person has a…","slug":"/reddit/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/l2a2wz/ysk_people_who_gossip_about_everyone_they_know/","title":"YSK people who gossip about everyone they know are probably doing it to you, too","date":"January 22, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"YSK那些对他们认识的每个人都说三道四的人可能也在对你说三道四。","the_new_excerpt":"这是不限于单一性别或年龄段的事情，人\n世界各地的人都这样做。\n\n如果你注意到，每次你和一个人一对一说话时，他们都有。\n对你的共同朋友（甚至是人）说些负面的或不光彩的事。\n你从来没有见过！），那个人有一个... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"YSK那些對他們認識的每個人都說三道四的人可能也在對你說三道四。","the_new_excerpt":"這是不限於單一性別或年齡段的事情，人\n世界各地的人都這樣做。\n\n如果你注意到，每次你和一個人一對一說話時，他們都有。\n對你的共同朋友（甚至是人）說些負面的或不光彩的事。\n你從來沒有見過！），那個人有一個... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-a9c518c7-d4f4-5d3e-be07-8dd083b8c3a2","excerpt":"My 3rd grader has been confused about how fractions work.
