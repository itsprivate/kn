Being able to back up your thoughts will make it so that you’re believing things an honest basis, and it helps encourage critical thinking and less impulsive, immediate agreement to something from initial exposure.</p>\n\n<p>I understand that the nature of faith means that people get to believe in whatever they please without having anything beyond faith as their reasoning for buying into whatever they believe in.</p>\n\n<p>It is another thing however when people question you and ask you support what you believe in and you run away from the conversation by insisting you have the right to what you believe in, as if that was trying to be taken away from you.</p>\n\n<p>Don’t feel pressured to justify your thoughts and ideas to people simply because they press you for it, but if you honestly can’t bring anything more to the table other than “I’m allowed to believe” the chances are you aren’t really believing in anything for any specific or rational reasons, or reasons beyond thinking you just need to believe and that’s the end of things.</p>\n\n<p>Get away from faith for a moment, because people will defend the most illogical, irrational and highly unlikely to the grave out of fear or genuine devotion to what they believe in. When it comes to developing other opinions, about law, and ethics and social things, it’s important to have more than just gut instinct that tells you what you should and shouldn’t be about.</p>\n\n<p>Being misinformed or completely uninformed about something and taking a position, one way or the other, just makes you look like a tool, and quite possibly a fool. Unchecked, unverified ideology floats around far too many people’s heads because all that matters to them is that they like how they feel about that thing, and how their thoughts overall make them feel about themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Be aware of the lengths people will go to avoid having to explain their thoughts and ideas, and I mean in a perfectly appropriate, discussion type setting where questioning is warranted. Could be school, could be a courtroom, could be an online forum, etc.</p>\n\n<p>If I looked full of myself throughout this post, I can definitely see that and take blame where it’s due. I don’t think, however, that anyone can argue with an opinion or set of certain beliefs will at least be something more credible when there’s more than just personal sentiment attached to them.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/oz9ist/ysk_if_you_cant_defend_your_opinion_beyond_saying/","title":"YSK: If you can’t defend your opinion beyond saying you’re entitled to them, you should probably challenge them a bit more.","tags":["YouShouldKnow","reddit"],"date":"August 06, 2021","dateISO":"2021-08-06T16:44:30.000Z","datetime":"2021-08-06 16:44","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"oz9ist","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/oz9ist/ysk_if_you_cant_defend_your_opinion_beyond_saying/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/oz9ist/ysk_if_you_cant_defend_your_opinion_beyond_saying/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"YouShouldKnow","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow","author":"goddred","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/goddred","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"goddred","score":57,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"YSK: もし、自分の意見を守ることができないのであれば、もう少しチャレンジしてみてはいかがでしょうか。","the_new_excerpt":"なぜYSKなのか: - 信念や意見は、個人的な偏見を超えた事実や合理的な論理的結論があれば、より有効で信頼性の高いものとなります。\n個人的な偏見を超えて、合理的で論理的な結論があれば、信念や意見はより有効で信頼できるものです。以下のことができると\n自分の考えを裏付けることができれば、あなたは正直に物事を信じていることになります。\nまた、批判的な思考を促すことにもなりますし...。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"YSK：如果你不能为你的观点辩护，除了说你有权这样做，你也许应该多挑战一下。","the_new_excerpt":"为什么是YSK：--当有事实或理性时，一个信念或意见就更有效和可信。\n一个信念或意见，如果有事实或合理的、符合逻辑的结论，超越了个人的偏见，就更加有效和可信。能够\n能够支持你的想法将使你相信事情有一个诚实的基础。\n它有助于鼓励批判性思维和减少...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"YSK：如果你不能爲你的觀點辯護，除了說你有權這樣做，你也許應該多挑戰一下。","the_new_excerpt":"爲什麼是YSK：--當有事實或理性時，一個信念或意見就更有效和可信。\n一個信念或意見，如果有事實或合理的、符合邏輯的結論，超越了個人的偏見，就更加有效和可信。能夠\n能夠支持你的想法將使你相信事情有一個誠實的基礎。\n它有助於鼓勵批判性思維和減少...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ov6mmz","excerpt":"Why YSK: I've been wrestling back pain for months and this is likely the reason!\nI've added spacers to level things out more now and hopefully I don't have to\nsuffer as much anymore","slug":"/reddit/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/ov6mmz/ysk_if_you_are_working_a_lot_from_home_check_that/","title":"YSK If you are working a lot from home, check that your desk and floor are level (esp in older houses or wooden floors)","date":"August 06, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"YSK 自宅で仕事をすることが多い場合は、机と床が水平になっているかどうかを確認してください（特に古い家や木造の床の場合）。","the_new_excerpt":"YSKを選んだ理由: 何ヶ月も腰痛と格闘していたので、これが原因だと思います。\n今はスペーサーを追加して、より平らにしているので、今後はスペーサーを追加する必要がないことを願っています。\nこれでもう苦しまなくて済むと思います。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"YSK 如果你经常在家工作，请检查你的桌子和地板是否平整（特别是在老房子或木地板上）。","the_new_excerpt":"为什么选择YSK：我已经和背痛搏斗了好几个月，这很可能就是原因！我想知道我为什么选择YSK。\n我现在已经添加了垫片，使其更加平整，希望我不需要\n遭受那么多的痛苦","locale":"zh"},{"title":"YSK 如果你經常在家工作，請檢查你的桌子和地板是否平整（特別是在老房子或木地板上）。","the_new_excerpt":"爲什麼選擇YSK：我已經和背痛搏鬥了好幾個月，這很可能就是原因！我想知道我爲什麼選擇YSK。\n我現在已經添加了墊片，使其更加平整，希望我不需要\n遭受那麼多的痛苦","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-oz6mvk","excerpt":"Why YSK: a lot of abuse victims are stuck in an abusive relationship because\nthey believe it's their fault and don't deserve to escape.\n\nThe following link from the national domestic violence hotline has more detail.\nhttps://www.thehotline.org/resources/the-myth-of-mutual-abuse/","slug":"/reddit/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/oz6mvk/ysk_mutual_abuse_in_a_relationship_is_a_myth/","title":"YSK: mutual abuse in a relationship is a MYTH","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"August 06, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"YSK: 人間関係での相互虐待は神話である","the_new_excerpt":"なぜYSKなのかというと、多くの虐待被害者は、自分のせいで虐待を受けていると思い込んでいるため、虐待関係から抜け出せないでいるのです。\n自分のせいだと思い込み、逃げ出す価値がないからです。\n\nナショナル・ドメスティック・バイオレンス・ホットラインの以下のリンクに詳細があります。\nhttps://www.thehotline.org/resources/the-myth-of-mutual-abuse/","locale":"ja"},{"title":"YSK：关系中的相互虐待是一个神话故事","the_new_excerpt":"为什么是YSK：很多受虐者被困在受虐关系中，因为\n他们认为这是他们的错，不值得逃脱。\n\n以下来自全国家庭暴力热线的链接有更多细节。\nhttps://www.thehotline.org/resources/the-myth-of-mutual-abuse/","locale":"zh"},{"title":"YSK：關係中的相互虐待是一個神話故事","the_new_excerpt":"爲什麼是YSK：很多受虐者被困在受虐關係中，因爲\n他們認爲這是他們的錯，不值得逃脫。\n\n以下來自全國家庭暴力熱線的鏈接有更多細節。\nhttps://www.thehotline.org/resources/the-myth-of-mutual-abuse/","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-oz9ist","previousId":"RedditPost-ov6mmz","nextId":"RedditPost-oz6mvk","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/oz9ist/ysk_if_you_cant_defend_your_opinion_beyond_saying/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},
