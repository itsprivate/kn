Wiping off the hood prevents snow from flying back up at the windshield making it hard to see even with the wipers on and wiping it off the roof prevents it from flying back at others. \nI thought most people knew this but driving around I see way too many people that haven&#39;t done these things. </p>\n\n<p>The roof part is the most important and there&#39;s ice on the roof because that can do some damage to another car If it flies off at high speeds.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: so I just looked it up and it turns out that not wiping off your headlights is illegal in Michigan as well as allowing things to fly off your car that could impair other drivers view.
