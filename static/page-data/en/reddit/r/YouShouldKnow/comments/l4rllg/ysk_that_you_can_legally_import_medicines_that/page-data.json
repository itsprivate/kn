The FDA can take years to approve a medicine that was developed and approved in Europe, precious time for some patients.</p>\n\n<p>This is why the FDA allows the import of such medicines that are not yet approved in the States, on some conditions, and they&#39;re stipulated in the Personal Importation Policy. A few of the conditions: - The drug is for use for a serious condition for which effective treatment is not available in the US - The drug is considered not to represent an unreasonable risk - The individual importing the drug verifies in writing that it is for his or her own use</p>\n\n<p>Requirements for importing medicine into the US: - A prescription from the patient’s treating doctor in the US - An import letter written by the patient’s treating doctor in the US - A detailed description of the treatment plan</p>\n\n<p>With the help of a medical advisor and an attorney (from the Netherlands) to legal check, I&#39;ve written up a short PDF guide with all the details + what details a prescription should contain and an import letter model to follow.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://thesocialmedwork.com/custom/files/import-guides/guide-importing-medicine-USA.pdf\">https://thesocialmedwork.com/custom/files/import-guides/guide-importing-medicine-USA.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p>The PDF is branded by the Dutch organization I work for (that sources and delivers medicines on a case-by-case basis) because it&#39;s the document we send to our US patients so they know what paperwork to arrange in order to receive their medicine. </p>\n\n<p>I got approval to make it available to anyone at all since it&#39;s public information, just collected in one place, since we always get questions from people who want a certain medicine but are suspicious: &quot;Is this even legal?? How can my doctor prescribe a medicine if it&#39;s not approved in the States?&quot; or they need help with how an import letter should look like.</p>\n\n<p>Hope it&#39;s useful to someone.</p>\n\n<p>References: </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/industry/import-basics/personal-importation\">https://www.fda.gov/industry/import-basics/personal-importation</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/fda-basics/it-legal-me-personally-import-drugs\">https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/fda-basics/it-legal-me-personally-import-drugs</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/l4rllg/ysk_that_you_can_legally_import_medicines_that/","title":"YSK that you can legally import medicines that are not approved in the USA - FDA allows it under limited conditions","tags":["YouShouldKnow","reddit"],"date":"January 26, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-26T07:58:56.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-26 07:58","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"a777f873-0778-5e93-82f9-91937fe6beee","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/l4rllg/ysk_that_you_can_legally_import_medicines_that/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/l4rllg/ysk_that_you_can_legally_import_medicines_that/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"YouShouldKnow","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow","author":"verticalnoise","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/verticalnoise","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"verticalnoise","score":210,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"YSK，你可以合法地进口未在美国批准的药品--FDA允许在有限的条件下进口。","the_new_excerpt":"为什么是YSK：因为在其他国家开发并获得批准的有前途的药物需要\n年才能在美国获得批准，年有些美国患者病情严重\n可能没有。\n\n许多患有像ALS、多发性硬化症或某些癌症的人，他们可能没有。\n看不到改善或放缓的... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"YSK，你可以合法地進口未在美國批准的藥品--FDA允許在有限的條件下進口。","the_new_excerpt":"爲什麼是YSK：因爲在其他國家開發並獲得批准的有前途的藥物需要\n年才能在美國獲得批准，年有些美國患者病情嚴重\n可能沒有。\n\n許多患有像ALS、多發性硬化症或某些癌症的人，他們可能沒有。\n看不到改善或放緩的... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ee7be3d5-954f-57d7-a7a5-6e3fc69c98ba","excerpt":"Really all that is needed if they verbally tell you is “that’s awesome!” Or “\ngood for you”.
