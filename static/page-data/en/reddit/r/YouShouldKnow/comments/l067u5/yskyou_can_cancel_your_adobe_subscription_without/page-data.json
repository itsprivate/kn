The fee appeared under by billing history on the Adobe site despite it not appearing on my bank account or on Paypal, so it looked like I got away with it. Some people on other sub was worried they&#39;d send a collection agency after me, I thought that was unlikely but I did decide to try and ask customer service at Adobe for a refund for the 15 dollars just in case. They tried to weasel out of it(since i&#39;d hate it for over a month even though that first month was free because of the free trial) so I called their product a scam(which it is) and that seemed to give the person on the other end pause, eventually they said they wouldn&#39;t refund me my 15 bucks, but they did surprisingly agree with waive my cancellation fee despite me not asking them to do so.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/l067u5/yskyou_can_cancel_your_adobe_subscription_without/","title":"YSK-You can cancel your Adobe subscription without getting hit with a cancellation fee by using Paypal.","tags":["YouShouldKnow","reddit"],"date":"January 20, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-20T01:52:30.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-20 01:52","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"l067u5","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/l067u5/yskyou_can_cancel_your_adobe_subscription_without/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/l067u5/yskyou_can_cancel_your_adobe_subscription_without/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"YouShouldKnow","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow","author":"diamondedges","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/diamondedges","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"diamondedges","score":77,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"YSK-您可以通过使用Paypal取消您的Adobe订阅，而不会被收取取消费用。","the_new_excerpt":"\"为什么是YSK：\"因为这可以为你省下不少钱和许多\n头疼。\n\n因此，那些贪婪的混蛋在Adobe试图收取30块钱，取消我的。\n订阅，我自然不乐意了，所以我就通过\n把我的支付方式从借记卡改成Paypal，然后... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"YSK-您可以通過使用Paypal取消您的Adobe訂閱，而不會被收取取消費用。","the_new_excerpt":"\"爲什麼是YSK：\"因爲這可以爲你省下不少錢和許多\n頭疼。\n\n因此，那些貪婪的混蛋在Adobe試圖收取30塊錢，取消我的。\n訂閱，我自然不樂意了，所以我就通過\n把我的支付方式從借記卡改成Paypal，然後... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-l06q1h","excerpt":"Why YSK: its incredibly usefull when you want to show something and the video is\nlong or confusing.\n\nIf you do it right the link will take you to the video and the time you\nspecified.
