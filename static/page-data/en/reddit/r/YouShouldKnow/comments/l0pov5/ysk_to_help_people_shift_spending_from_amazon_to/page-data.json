It pulls together the products from clothing, home decor, kids, etc. stores near you and lets you shop them in one place rather than having to go to small-businesses’ websites 1-by-1. It also lets you filter the products by price and how close they are to you -- which alleviated a lot of my fears about unique products being too expensive and that they wouldn’t get to me in time. My girlfriend is super buy-local so I used it over the holidays to buy her gifts -- a ring, a plant and a backpack. It was actually super fun to see all these unique stores with unique products in one spot -- a lot less boring than going to your typical corporate retailer.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/l0pov5/ysk_to_help_people_shift_spending_from_amazon_to/","title":"YSK To help people shift spending from Amazon to local businesses, someone released a plugin that suggests products from stores in your city when you're shopping online","tags":["YouShouldKnow","reddit"],"date":"January 20, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-20T08:01:42.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-20 08:01","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"l0pov5","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/l0pov5/ysk_to_help_people_shift_spending_from_amazon_to/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/l0pov5/ysk_to_help_people_shift_spending_from_amazon_to/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"YouShouldKnow","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow","author":"DCEagles911","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/DCEagles911","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"DCEagles911","score":148,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"YSK 为了帮助人们将消费从亚马逊转移到本地企业，有人发布了一个插件，当你在网上购物时，可以推荐你所在城市的商店的产品。","the_new_excerpt":"WHY YSK尽管在电视上看到 \"支持小企业 \"的呼吁。\n没有一个人真正告诉你如何以一种真正方便的方式来做这件事。\n并与您正常的网上购物体验持平....。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"YSK 爲了幫助人們將消費從亞馬遜轉移到本地企業，有人發佈了一個插件，當你在網上購物時，可以推薦你所在城市的商店的產品。","the_new_excerpt":"WHY YSK儘管在電視上看到 \"支持小企業 \"的呼籲。\n沒有一個人真正告訴你如何以一種真正方便的方式來做這件事。\n並與您正常的網上購物體驗持平....。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-l0uuh8","excerpt":"Why YSK is because this is a good thing since the material gets a second use\nbefore going into a landfill.
