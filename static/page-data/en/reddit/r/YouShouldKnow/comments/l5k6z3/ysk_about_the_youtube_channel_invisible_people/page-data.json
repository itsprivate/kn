I don&#39;t have any involvement with the channel, but after watching a bunch of their videos I&#39;ve really been woken up to the perception of homelessness in the U.S. </p>\n\n<p>People seem to think that the unhoused deserve their position in life, and that they are all addicted to drugs or mentally ill. A lot of the people in these videos actually have jobs (sometimes more than one) but still can&#39;t afford rent.</p>\n\n<p>Then the response is &quot;well move then,&quot; which as many of these people explain is impossible. Whether it&#39;s cost prohibitive, or estranging them from their support network, or just because where they are is home to them, they just can not pick up and go rent somewhere cheaper.</p>\n\n<p>These are COMMON perceptions, and I bet if anyone is reading this, you most likely have these beliefs (consciously or unconsciously) and that doesn&#39;t make us bad people; there is just a lack of exposure to the condition of homelessness so we&#39;re forced to make assumptions about it. </p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s why I&#39;m posting about this YouTube channel. Honestly I would watch a variety channels if there was content like this being produced, but it&#39;s not. So hopefully someone sees this and either spreads word about it or does something similar in their own area because we IGNORE this gigantic humanitarian crisis happening on our doorstep! </p>\n\n<p>Thanks for reading!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/l5k6z3/ysk_about_the_youtube_channel_invisible_people/","title":"YSK about the YouTube channel \"Invisible People\"","tags":["YouShouldKnow","reddit"],"date":"January 27, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-27T08:52:00.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-27 08:52","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"60fd2e6e-2c05-57c8-87f6-2fa14d432b0d","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/l5k6z3/ysk_about_the_youtube_channel_invisible_people/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/l5k6z3/ysk_about_the_youtube_channel_invisible_people/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"YouShouldKnow","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow","author":"eggbert_thophthysis","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/eggbert_thophthysis","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"eggbert_thophthysis","score":357,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"YSK关于YouTube频道 \"看不见的人\"","the_new_excerpt":"为什么是YSK：无家可归的故事与身边的完全不同。\n比起主流媒体对它的描述，无家可归的人。\n\n如果你没有听说过，这个频道是一个采访的集合。\n无家可归的人讲述他们如何成为无家可归者的故事。我没有\n任何...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"YSK關於YouTube頻道 \"看不見的人\"","the_new_excerpt":"爲什麼是YSK：無家可歸的故事與身邊的完全不同。\n比起主流媒體對它的描述，無家可歸的人。\n\n如果你沒有聽說過，這個頻道是一個採訪的集合。\n無家可歸的人講述他們如何成爲無家可歸者的故事。我沒有\n任何...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ca8dc6b4-933e-564e-b742-4380133905e1","excerpt":"Why YSK: Manufacturers and sellers like to use lots of vague keywords that make\nit impossible to search for stuff that matters.
