Some are very easy to access, a quick twist and rinse/light scrub with a brush and they’re good to go. Other filters are deeper in the dishwasher and require you to take the dishwasher apart. Other dishwashers don’t have filters you can access. Check your manual or YouTube for videos on how to clean your dishwasher filter. Why YSK, they don’t clean or run as efficiently when they’re full of gunk. </p>\n\n<p>Also, tossing 1 cup of bleach in the bottom and running it on the hottest, longest cycle will help to disinfect it. \nEdit: <a href=\"/u/OlyScott\">/u/OlyScott</a> pointed out you shouldn’t use bleach if you have a stainless steel dishwasher. Source: <a href=\"https://www.reference.com/world-view/can-use-bleach-clean-dishwasher-ae034ef1bea959f9\">https://www.reference.com/world-view/can-use-bleach-clean-dishwasher-ae034ef1bea959f9</a>\nEdit 2: Instead of bleach you can use vinegar-it seems to be the preferred method by many people. </p>\n\n<p>Recent before and after of a filter cleaning I did:\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/gallery/87N0H4H\">https://imgur.com/gallery/87N0H4H</a>\nEdit 3: That isn’t my dishwasher-it’s my boyfriend’s parent’s dishwasher. It’s been in their house for 15 years and the filter was never cleaned (because they didn’t know it existed). They do a quick scrape of the big foodstuff, and they don’t always rinse well before loading like you should-I’m guessing that’s why it looks so putrid. \nEdit 4: Another edit because I certainly don’t know it all-a few people pointed out that you should scrape all the big food-stuffs but NOT rinse before putting your dishes in because the detergent attaches to to food particles to do its job. <a href=\"/u/giddy-girly-banana\">/u/giddy-girly-banana</a> cited: <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/story/diy/dishwasher-cleaning-tips/\">https://www.popsci.com/story/diy/dishwasher-cleaning-tips/</a> <a href=\"/u/naurugger\">/u/naurugger</a> cited <a href=\"https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/home/cleaning/a33322/stop-prerinsing-dishes/\">https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/home/cleaning/a33322/stop-prerinsing-dishes/</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/kumvbb/ysk_many_dishwashers_have_filters_that_need_to_be/","title":"YSK many dishwashers have filters that need to be pulled out and cleaned.","tags":["YouShouldKnow","reddit"],"date":"January 14, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-14T21:04:41.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-14 21:04","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"90770ce9-e477-5ac7-8b9b-2e5d0e6011c9","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/kumvbb/ysk_many_dishwashers_have_filters_that_need_to_be/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/kumvbb/ysk_many_dishwashers_have_filters_that_need_to_be/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"YouShouldKnow","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow","author":"missblondie89","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/missblondie89","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"missblondie89","score":19846,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"YSK很多洗碗机都有过滤器，需要拉出来清洗。","the_new_excerpt":"YSK很多洗碗机的过滤器都需要拉出来清洗。\n定期，特别是如果你不冲洗你的餐具。有些人很容易\n访问，快速扭转和冲洗/轻刷擦洗，他们是好去。\n其他的过滤器在洗碗机里比较深，需要你拿...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"YSK很多洗碗機都有過濾器，需要拉出來清洗。","the_new_excerpt":"YSK很多洗碗機的過濾器都需要拉出來清洗。\n定期，特別是如果你不沖洗你的餐具。有些人很容易\n訪問，快速扭轉和沖洗/輕刷擦洗，他們是好去。\n其他的過濾器在洗碗機裏比較深，需要你拿...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-285e08d7-a4fc-5869-9e88-7255eb1c963d","excerpt":"Why YSK: it's quality education from accredited universities which can help you\nin your career or just be really interesting, while costing you nothing and not\nrequiring you to leave your house.\n\nApplications for some autumn 2021 courses are open until the 15th of January, so\ngo take a look now at…","slug":"/reddit/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/kwi67g/ysk_that_eu_citizens_can_take_college_courses/","title":"YSK that EU citizens can take college courses from Swedish universities for FREE online","date":"January 14, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"YSK，欧盟公民可以免费在线学习瑞典大学的大学课程。","the_new_excerpt":"为什么选择YSK：它是来自认可的大学的优质教育，可以帮助你。\n在你的职业生涯中，或者只是真的很有趣，而不花费你的成本，不\n要求你足不出户。\n\n2021年秋季部分课程的申请时间截止到1月15日，所以。\n现在就去看看...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"YSK，歐盟公民可以免費在線學習瑞典大學的大學課程。","the_new_excerpt":"爲什麼選擇YSK：它是來自認可的大學的優質教育，可以幫助你。\n在你的職業生涯中，或者只是真的很有趣，而不花費你的成本，不\n要求你足不出戶。\n\n2021年秋季部分課程的申請時間截止到1月15日，所以。\n現在就去看看...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-70534712-8b93-550b-88c1-60dc3d272753","excerpt":"Why YSK: laser pointers can be a serious problem to your pets mental health.
