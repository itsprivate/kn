If you can tell that your lights are lighting any of their mirrors, this means the driver is blinded, and it could make it extremely hard for them to see (especially the side mirrors that don’t have a tinted mode). That’s what these mirrors do: redirect light from behind the car to the driver’s eyes. Imagine trying to drive at night while someone is shining a flashlight in your eyes. That would suck. <strong>This does not only apply to high beams either</strong>, you could just have a taller car than the one in front.</p>\n\n<p>Another clue is if your lights are illuminating high up street signs. If the light spreads high enough to light a sign, you are likely blinding drivers in front of you. Please be courteous. And if they slow down to let you pass in order to not be blinded, don’t flash your high beams out of road rage because they’re going too slow. They simply cannot see.</p>\n\n<p>E: The reverse is also true. If you have a shorter car, not everyone behind you is an asshole with their high beams on. Your car is just short enough to be in their normal headlights’ field of view. Just stay out of the passing lane and try to drive safely.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/lvrpgx/ysk_if_your_headlights_are_illuminating_any/","title":"YSK: If your headlights are illuminating any mirrors of the car in front of you, you are blinding the driver.","tags":["YouShouldKnow","reddit"],"date":"March 02, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-02T15:37:54.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-02 15:37","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"64888366-6cdd-5402-9446-5e93dd84f329","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/lvrpgx/ysk_if_your_headlights_are_illuminating_any/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/lvrpgx/ysk_if_your_headlights_are_illuminating_any/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"YouShouldKnow","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow","author":"Hooked__On__Chronics","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Hooked__On__Chronics","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Hooked__On__Chronics","score":87,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"YSK：如果你的大灯照亮了前车的任何一个后视镜，那么你就会使司机失明。","the_new_excerpt":"为什么 YSK: 我想人们可能根本没有意识到他们在蒙蔽别人的时候\n的司机。如果你能看出你的灯在照亮他们的任何后视镜。\n这意味着司机是盲目的，它可以使他们非常困难的\n来看（尤其是没有有色模式的侧后视镜）....。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"YSK：如果你的大燈照亮了前車的任何一個後視鏡，那麼你就會使司機失明。","the_new_excerpt":"爲什麼 YSK: 我想人們可能根本沒有意識到他們在矇蔽別人的時候\n的司機。如果你能看出你的燈在照亮他們的任何後視鏡。\n這意味着司機是盲目的，它可以使他們非常困難的\n來看（尤其是沒有有色模式的側後視鏡）....。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-909d0914-85d3-5641-ac1f-77c86e672d78","excerpt":"Why YSK: I was a Manager in the Customer Service/E-Commerce industry for over a\ndecade, companies will almost always blame the low-level employees for a\nnegative survey, even if the customer is upset about things completely out of an\nagent's control.\n\nIf you've got an issue with the company or their…","slug":"/reddit/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/lvnhqj/ysk_when_you_submit_a_negative_survey_for/","title":"YSK when you submit a negative survey for companies like Amazon, Netflix, Comcast, etc., the results are generally used to punish the specific worker, not improve the company.","date":"March 02, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"YSK当你提交亚马逊、Netflix、Comcast等公司的负面调查时，结果一般是用来惩罚具体的工作者，而不是改善公司。","the_new_excerpt":"为什么选择YSK: 我曾在客户服务/电子商务行业担任经理一职超过一年。\n十年，公司几乎都会把责任归咎于低层员工，因为他们是一个\n负面调查，即使客户对事情的不满完全出乎意料\n代理人的控制。\n\n如果你对公司或他们有意见...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"YSK當你提交亞馬遜、Netflix、Comcast等公司的負面調查時，結果一般是用來懲罰具體的工作者，而不是改善公司。","the_new_excerpt":"爲什麼選擇YSK: 我曾在客戶服務/電子商務行業擔任經理一職超過一年。\n十年，公司幾乎都會把責任歸咎於低層員工，因爲他們是一個\n負面調查，即使客戶對事情的不滿完全出乎意料\n代理人的控制。\n\n如果你對公司或他們有意見...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-26df7702-53fb-5463-b8db-3af5a0949aa1","excerpt":"Why YSK: If you’re wondering why your food is always coming out of the microwave\nrubbery, tough, and otherwise gross, it’s probably because you reheated your\nfood improperly.\n\nThe “time cook” and “power level” settings are your best friend.
