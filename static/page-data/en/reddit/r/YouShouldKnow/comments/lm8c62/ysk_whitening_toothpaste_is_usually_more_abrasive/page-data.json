The most commonly used elements are calcium carbonate, silica, aluminum hydroxide, and phosphates of aluminum or calcium. They will scrub and scrape away plaque and tartar – and thereby give you cleaner and whiter looking teeth.</p>\n\n<p>Now that’s all good, but unfortunately, the scrubbing and scraping also remove some of the outer layers of your teeth. This protective outer layer, called the enamel, is therefore at risk of being permanently damaged. To avoid this from happening, many people prefer to use a non-abrasive toothpaste. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you suffer from bad teeth, and you&#39;re using whitening toothpaste, you may want to switch to a regular, non-whitening toothpaste instead.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/lm8c62/ysk_whitening_toothpaste_is_usually_more_abrasive/","title":"YSK: \"Whitening\" toothpaste is usually more abrasive than regular toothpaste and will wear down your enamel faster.
