They can be seen in certain actions or words. Constant apologizing is a big red flag as is fear of making a mistake or upsetting their partner. People who have been emotionally and/or mentally abused are harder to love, they have self doubt, they&#39;ve been called and told they are awful things and have come to believe them, they have major walls and baggage, a normal argument can scare them, and they often are waiting for the other shoe to drop when they find a good relationship.
