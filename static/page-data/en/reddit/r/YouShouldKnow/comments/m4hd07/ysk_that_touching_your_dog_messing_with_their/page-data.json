Messing with your dog&#39;s ears, paws, tail, stomach, etc. will also help you with grooming them, as they will be used to you touching them. This also will help you notice when something is wrong. My mom spent hours with her GSD puppy just messing with him, and she knew how he acted normally vs. how he acts when he is sick/upset. This saved his life when he had dog bloat, and he is happy and healthy two years later. Get to know your dogs, and it not only will make life so much easier when grooming them, but it might also save your furry friend&#39;s life!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/m4hd07/ysk_that_touching_your_dog_messing_with_their/","title":"YSK that touching your dog (Messing with their paws, looking in their ears etc.) can save their life","tags":["YouShouldKnow","reddit"],"date":"March 14, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-14T05:24:52.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-14 05:24","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"a84bcfdb-b95e-5b0b-b84d-fa270795edbd","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/m4hd07/ysk_that_touching_your_dog_messing_with_their/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/m4hd07/ysk_that_touching_your_dog_messing_with_their/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"YouShouldKnow","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow","author":"DoctorDilemmaa","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/DoctorDilemmaa","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"DoctorDilemmaa","score":13126,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"YSK说，抚摸你的狗（乱摸它们的爪子，看它们的耳朵等）可以救它们的命。","the_new_excerpt":"为什么是YSK：有些狗主人可以一边看狗，一边进行\n健康危机，而不知道这是一个健康危机，特别是与事情，如\n狗的胀气。捣乱狗狗的耳朵、爪子、尾巴、肚子等也会。\n帮助你梳理他们，因为他们会习惯你... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"YSK說，撫摸你的狗（亂摸它們的爪子，看它們的耳朵等）可以救它們的命。","the_new_excerpt":"爲什麼是YSK：有些狗主人可以一邊看狗，一邊進行\n健康危機，而不知道這是一個健康危機，特別是與事情，如\n狗的脹氣。搗亂狗狗的耳朵、爪子、尾巴、肚子等也會。\n幫助你梳理他們，因爲他們會習慣你... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-dc20172e-95ee-5b8d-ab6f-f3870fb06b8c","excerpt":"Why YSK : it will save money","slug":"/reddit/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/m4akth/yskwhen_buying_cheap_faked_electronic_accessories/","title":"YSK:when buying cheap faked electronic accessories be aware worst thing is not that it will not work well but it can damage your phone you attach it too.i leaned hard way by buying 5$ USB c headphones to use with 800$phone and they caused mechanical damage to port","date":"March 14, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"YSK:当买到便宜的假电子配件时，要注意最糟糕的事情不是它不能正常工作，而是它可能会损坏你的手机，你把它连接起来。我买了5美元的USB C耳机与800美元的手机一起使用，他们造成了机械损坏的端口。","the_new_excerpt":"为什么选择YSK：它可以节省成本","locale":"zh"},{"title":"YSK:當買到便宜的假電子配件時，要注意最糟糕的事情不是它不能正常工作，而是它可能會損壞你的手機，你把它連接起來。我買了5美元的USB C耳機與800美元的手機一起使用，他們造成了機械損壞的端口。","the_new_excerpt":"爲什麼選擇YSK：它可以節省成本","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-5a096bf2-9545-5789-843f-7a9284bed23a","excerpt":"Why YSK: people are getting more and more divided on almost every topic and\nstrong emotions can arise very easily.
