You also don’t need to be what people stereotype as the ‘high-risk’ category or have had indicators or warnings that you could be at risk. </p>\n\n<p>The chest pain, arm pain, shoulder pain were there BUT it may not be the “type” of pain you expect. I had waves of tightness dead center in my chest that would come and go every few minutes. It was a burning feeling. It was lower on my sternum than I’d have thought. I had never had a heart attack nor indigestion so naturally, I assumed it was the latter and my research online convinced me it was. </p>\n\n<p>I assumed it would have been a sharper pain on my upper arm/shoulder and a sharper, more acute pain closer to where we mistakenly generally consider our heart to be...upper left chest. In fact, my symptoms were almost line-by-line identical to that of heartburn or indigestion ... it wasn’t, and the difference can be life or death. </p>\n\n<p>My arms hurt but it was more of a burning pain on the back of both arms. Vomiting and sweating followed a few hours into it which was the big red flag...the ambulance not far behind the vomiting. The rest was a blur until the ICU but I do remember some of it. </p>\n\n<p>I made the common mistake of equating the symptoms to heartburn or indigestion and should have gone to the ER 10 hours sooner and therefore found myself VERY lucky to have made it through. </p>\n\n<p>PLS don’t fuck around. I’m not an older guy, I’m not in bad shape and had never had indicators that I was high risk.</p>\n\n<p>A friends mother passed away a few years ago from a heart attack and by all accounts, it seemed to be a stomach bug. Nausea, hot spells and general stomach issues. Went to bed and never woke up, and in hindsight, if I knew then what we know now, we would have called for medical attention and possibly changed the outcome. She too wasn’t at the age you’d expect nor was she overweight or the typical high-risk category. Entirely different from what I experienced or would have expected from a cardiac event. </p>\n\n<p><strong>If you suspect a heart attack, do yourself and your loved ones a favor and treat it as such.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Better to be safe and be in the ER than be stubborn and wind up in the morgue. </p>\n\n<p>WebMD is NOT going to save your life because you thought you had symptoms of something somewhat mundane.</p>\n\n<p>WHY YSK - *<em>IT COULD BE YOU. IT COULD BE YOUR LOVED ONE. YOU DON’T HAVE TO BE ELDERLY, OVERWEIGHT OR PREDISPOSED. JUST BECAUSE IT DOESN’T FEEL LIKE WHAT YOU MAY EXPECT, DOESN’T MEAN YOU SHOULDN’T TAKE IT VERY SERIOUSLY. *</em></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/le5v6d/ysk_that_the_symptoms_of_a_heart_attack_may_be/","title":"YSK that the symptoms of a heart attack may be quite different than what you’d expect.","tags":["YouShouldKnow","reddit"],"date":"February 07, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-07T04:43:52.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-07 04:43","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"cf19d74c-fa7b-508f-8c9f-9c245b839f57","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/le5v6d/ysk_that_the_symptoms_of_a_heart_attack_may_be/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/le5v6d/ysk_that_the_symptoms_of_a_heart_attack_may_be/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"YouShouldKnow","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow","author":"surf_rider","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/surf_rider","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"surf_rider","score":5625,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"YSK说，心脏病发作的症状可能与你所期望的完全不同。","the_new_excerpt":"作为一个不到半年前曾有过心脏病的人，症状和体征\n可能不是你所期望的。你也不需要成为人们刻板印象中的那样\n高风险 \"类别，或有指标或警告，你可能会在。\n险。\n\n胸痛、臂痛、肩痛都有... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"YSK說，心臟病發作的症狀可能與你所期望的完全不同。","the_new_excerpt":"作爲一個不到半年前曾有過心臟病的人，症狀和體徵\n可能不是你所期望的。你也不需要成爲人們刻板印象中的那樣\n高風險 \"類別，或有指標或警告，你可能會在。\n險。\n\n胸痛、臂痛、肩痛都有... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-e140301a-d89b-5b6e-8c8f-16e0ed8d1428","excerpt":"Why YSK:\n\nThe US stimulus checks were based off of 2019 tax returns, but due to this, many\npeople who should have gotten the money in 2020 did not qualify, as they were\neither dependents in 2019 and now independents, or were above the salary\nthreshold in 2019 but laid off in 2020, or merely did not…","slug":"/reddit/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/laenb3/ysk_if_you_did_not_receive_the_us_stimulus_checks/","title":"YSK If you did not receive the US stimulus checks, you may be able to get the money you are owed as part of your 2020 tax returns","date":"February 06, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"YSK如果你没有收到美国的经济刺激支票，你可能会在2020年报税时拿到被拖欠的钱。","the_new_excerpt":"为什么是YSK。\n\n美国的刺激政策检查是基于2019年的纳税申报，但由于这一点，许多人\n本应在2020年拿到钱的人没有资格，因为他们是\n要么是2019年的家属，现在是独立人士，要么是在工资以上的人\n2019年的门槛，但2020年下岗，或者仅仅是没有...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"YSK如果你沒有收到美國的經濟刺激支票，你可能會在2020年報稅時拿到被拖欠的錢。","the_new_excerpt":"爲什麼是YSK。\n\n美國的刺激政策檢查是基於2019年的納稅申報，但由於這一點，許多人\n本應在2020年拿到錢的人沒有資格，因爲他們是\n要麼是2019年的家屬，現在是獨立人士，要麼是在工資以上的人\n2019年的門檻，但2020年下崗，或者僅僅是沒有...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-c020e1b1-1fb6-5826-a22f-1a244be15fe4","excerpt":"Why YSK: It's almost valentines day, and you might be ordering flowers soon or\nhave relatives (especially elderly) who might.
