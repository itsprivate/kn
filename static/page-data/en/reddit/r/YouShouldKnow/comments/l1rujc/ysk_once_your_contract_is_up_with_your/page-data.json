That department always has the cheapest deals available. Longer you&#39;ve been with the company, the cheaper they can usually get it. These departments are almost always US agents too.</p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t be rude to these people but handle the conversation very business like. If they offer you something cheap enough you like it, right before you agree, ask if they can add in any free channels like Showtime or Starz (HBO doesn&#39;t allow discounts). Make sure the channels automatically cancel themselves after 3 months if not set a reminder on your phone. Cancel them on a Sunday, those are the slowest days usually.</p>\n\n<p>Get their first name and operator ID as well. This is possible to lookup if they&#39;re in the US, just in case they&#39;re lying to you. Asking at the beginning of the call usually will make someone play by the book though.</p>\n\n<p>OH also try not to let them lower your level of service. They usually can lower your price back to where it was without taking away services.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/l1rujc/ysk_once_your_contract_is_up_with_your/","title":"YSK: once your contract is up with your internet/tv/cellphone/security system provider, call in and say you want the cancelation department.
