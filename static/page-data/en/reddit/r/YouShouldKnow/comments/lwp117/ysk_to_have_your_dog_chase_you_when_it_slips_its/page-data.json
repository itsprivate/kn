Instead, call your dogs name in a playful voice, and say something like “come and get me” and make them think it’s a game, and run in the safest direction for your dog (e.g. away from the street). Your dog is much more likely to think it’s a game and come to you while trying to chase you. </p>\n\n<p>This is not one size fits all, and dogs have different reactions so practice this first in a controlled setting and get your dog used to chasing you when you initiate, as well as practicing recall. It could save a dogs life. </p>\n\n<p>Source: I don’t remember where I learned this but I’ve had to do it a handful of times for my 8.5 month old Great Dane puppy and it works like a charm.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/lwp117/ysk_to_have_your_dog_chase_you_when_it_slips_its/","title":"YSK to have your dog chase you when it slips it’s leash or harness instead of chasing it","tags":["YouShouldKnow","reddit"],"date":"March 04, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-04T00:57:20.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-04 00:57","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"f26e7319-72ce-53fd-9223-ac7ad7dd95af","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/lwp117/ysk_to_have_your_dog_chase_you_when_it_slips_its/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/lwp117/ysk_to_have_your_dog_chase_you_when_it_slips_its/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"YouShouldKnow","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow","author":"cholnic","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/cholnic","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"cholnic","score":183,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"YSK在狗狗滑落的时候让它追赶你，而不是追赶它。","the_new_excerpt":"为什么YSK：当你的狗离开你时，追赶它并不总是最好的办法。\n想法，因为他们可以跑得又快又远，很容易就能摆脱你。反之。\n嬉皮笑脸地叫你的狗的名字，并说 \"快来抓我 \"之类的话。\n让他们认为这是一个游戏， 并运行在最安全的方向... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"YSK在狗狗滑落的時候讓它追趕你，而不是追趕它。","the_new_excerpt":"爲什麼YSK：當你的狗離開你時，追趕它並不總是最好的辦法。\n想法，因爲他們可以跑得又快又遠，很容易就能擺脫你。反之。\n嬉皮笑臉地叫你的狗的名字，並說 \"快來抓我 \"之類的話。\n讓他們認爲這是一個遊戲， 並運行在最安全的方向... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-a3230794-5a98-57df-aa11-91b8cfa770b7","excerpt":"Why YSK: Right now, many unsuspecting parents of young kids are bringing home\npuppies, only to realize that raising them all together is a Herculean task.\n\nDogs are man’s best friend, and we have a romanticized idea of puppies “growing\nup with our kids.” Ironically, puppies and young children…","slug":"/reddit/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/lwhuq3/ysk_puppies_and_young_children_make_terrible/","title":"YSK: Puppies and young children make terrible playmates (95% of the time)","date":"March 04, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"YSK: 小狗和小孩是可怕的玩伴（95%的时间）。","the_new_excerpt":"为什么是YSK: 现在，许多不怀好意的父母把年幼的孩子带回了家。\n小狗，却发现把它们一起养大是一项艰巨的任务。\n\n狗是人类最好的朋友，我们对小狗的 \"成长 \"有一个浪漫的想法，那就是\n与我们的孩子。\" 讽刺的是，小狗和幼童...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"YSK: 小狗和小孩是可怕的玩伴（95%的時間）。","the_new_excerpt":"爲什麼是YSK: 現在，許多不懷好意的父母把年幼的孩子帶回了家。\n小狗，卻發現把它們一起養大是一項艱鉅的任務。\n\n狗是人類最好的朋友，我們對小狗的 \"成長 \"有一個浪漫的想法，那就是\n與我們的孩子。\" 諷刺的是，小狗和幼童...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-d02b7627-a852-52bb-a329-5808dfec359b","excerpt":"Why YSK: Because in this situation most people will look for a gas station or\nrestaurant first but because of current world situations those places have shut\ntheir restrooms down.
