Rather than letting you cancel on their website, they make you call them on the phone, wait on hold, talk to a representative, explain your reason for canceling, get transferred to the loyalty department, etc. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/companies-must-let-customers-cancel-subscriptions-online-california-law-says/\">California passed a law</a> a couple of years ago that requires all companies that let you sign up for recurring subscriptions online (like Sirius XM, a newspaper, etc.) to let you unsubscribe online as well. I don’t live in California and I was trying to cancel a subscription. I didn’t want to deal with the hassle of calling on the phone but the company’s website said that was the only way to cancel. So I changed my billing address to some random place in California, logged out and back in, and a button appeared allowing me to cancel online. Seriously, it was that easy. </p>\n\n<p>Why YSK: No one should have to jump through hoops to cancel a service they signed up for with the click of a button online. A simple switch of your address to California will make your life easier and undermine the unethical practice of companies making you call to cancel.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/li5p6i/ysk_you_dont_have_to_call_to_cancel_a/","title":"YSK: You don’t have to call to cancel a subscription if you pretend to live in California","tags":["YouShouldKnow","reddit"],"date":"February 12, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-12T21:51:37.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-12 21:51","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"c9c45d53-f4f0-5afb-9a95-ab92f373847e","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/li5p6i/ysk_you_dont_have_to_call_to_cancel_a/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/li5p6i/ysk_you_dont_have_to_call_to_cancel_a/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"YouShouldKnow","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow","author":"mattkg92","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/mattkg92","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"mattkg92","score":94,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"YSK：如果你假装住在加州，就不用打电话取消订阅了。","the_new_excerpt":"有些公司让你跳过圈圈来取消订阅。而不是\n让你在他们的网站上取消，他们让你打电话给他们的电话，等待。\n等候，与代表交谈，解释你取消的原因，获得\n转移到忠诚部门等。\n\n加州通过了一项...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"YSK：如果你假裝住在加州，就不用打電話取消訂閱了。","the_new_excerpt":"有些公司讓你跳過圈圈來取消訂閱。而不是\n讓你在他們的網站上取消，他們讓你打電話給他們的電話，等待。\n等候，與代表交談，解釋你取消的原因，獲得\n轉移到忠誠部門等。\n\n加州通過了一項...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-d87d7037-3692-5ff2-92d8-a3a2cc852efa","excerpt":"Why YSK: A family member has a certain medication that needs to be refilled\nevery month.
