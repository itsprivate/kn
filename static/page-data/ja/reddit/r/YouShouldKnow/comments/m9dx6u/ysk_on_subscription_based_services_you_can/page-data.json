My wife and I both have satellite radio enabled cars. I don&#39;t have mine active because I don&#39;t listen to music often enough (I prefer podcasts, audibooks, etc). I still get special advertisements all the time about restarting my service. I happened to get one of these just after my wife&#39;s subscription price automatically renewed at the &quot;going rate&quot; (or whatever you call that ridiculously high rate they charge if you don&#39;t call and bother them). I called them up and asked for the special rate I had just been offered. \nThe guy pulls up the account and offers me some other offer which is cheaper than regular, but not as good as what I had. I asked him if I couldn&#39;t get the deal I called about. He responded &quot;we have to get an answer on this deal first: do you want it, yes or no.&quot; My response was &quot;not if I can get this other offer&quot;, which he then repeated his line and I realized he was following his script literally and had to offer me some low-ball offer first before proceeding to the offer I was interested in, so I told him no and I could hear him sigh with relief as he proceeded to pull up the offer I wanted and offer it to me. I was tempted to see if there was an even better offer out there by answering no again, but didn&#39;t want to push my luck and end up canceling the service (and making the Mrs. upset). </p>\n\n<p>Moral of the story, you can (almost) always get your subscription based service cheaper if you call and ask. You may have to threaten to cancel (and don&#39;t be afraid to follow through if they say no, because sometimes they think your threat is empty and won&#39;t try to sell you until you are serious).</p>\n\n<p>Edit: fixed spelling (I do know how to spell, just on mobile). Also thanks for 1k upvotes!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/m9dx6u/ysk_on_subscription_based_services_you_can/","title":"YSK: On subscription based services, you can usually get a cheaper rate, if you call and ask.","tags":["YouShouldKnow","reddit"],"date":"March 22, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-22T09:37:31.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-22 09:37","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"m9dx6u","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/m9dx6u/ysk_on_subscription_based_services_you_can/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/m9dx6u/ysk_on_subscription_based_services_you_can/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"YouShouldKnow","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow","author":"chemist612","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/chemist612","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"chemist612","score":1124,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"YSK：在基于订阅的服务上，如果你打电话询问，通常可以得到更便宜的价格。","the_new_excerpt":"为什么是YSK：我刚刚遇到了这种情况，我的妻子和我都有卫星广播。我妻子和我都有卫星广播\n启用的汽车。我没有激活我的，因为我不经常听音乐。\n够（我更喜欢播客、audibook等）。我还是会收到特别的广告\n所有的时间关于重新启动我的服务。我碰巧得到一个...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"YSK：在基於訂閱的服務上，如果你打電話詢問，通常可以得到更便宜的價格。","the_new_excerpt":"爲什麼是YSK：我剛剛遇到了這種情況，我的妻子和我都有衛星廣播。我妻子和我都有衛星廣播\n啓用的汽車。我沒有激活我的，因爲我不經常聽音樂。\n夠（我更喜歡播客、audibook等）。我還是會收到特別的廣告\n所有的時間關於重新啓動我的服務。我碰巧得到一個...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m9yqva","excerpt":"Why YSK: A lot of people don’t utilize their bank’s online bill pay feature,\nmyself included up until about a year ago.
