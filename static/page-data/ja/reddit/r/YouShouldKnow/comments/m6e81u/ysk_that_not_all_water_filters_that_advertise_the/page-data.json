Not enough for an EPA violation but still more than I want to drink on a regular basis. When I went to buy replacement filters for my new fridge, I found <a href=\"https://morefilter.com/glacialpure-3pack-eptwfu01-refrigerator-water-filter\">these</a> which claim to be both &quot;NSF certified&quot; and capable of removing &quot;99% of lead&quot; at 1/3 the price of the OEM filter replacements.</p>\n\n<p>This seems like a great deal, but here&#39;s the thing; there are actually different levels of NSF certification, and while they call these &quot;certified filters&quot; and say that certified filters remove 99% of lead, they&#39;re actually referring to two different types of certification. These filters and the majority of third party filters out there are NSF 42 certified. They&#39;re even kind enough to link you to the <a href=\"http://info.nsf.org/Certified/DWTU/Listings.asp?Company=C0553011&amp;Standard=042\">Certificate on the NSF website</a>. But if you go to that certificate you can clearly see that all it certifies is &quot;Tested at a flow rate of 0.66 gpm to a capacity of 300 gallons for the reduction of Chlorine.&quot; This is because NSF 42 certification only certifies the removal of odors and taste caused by chlorine. It does NOT certify in any way the removal of lead or any other harmful metal / mineral.</p>\n\n<p>The ONLY filters that are actually certified to remove lead are NSF 53 certified filters. In my case the <a href=\"https://www.frigidaire.com/Filters--Accessories/Filters/Water-Filters/EPTWFU01/\">OEM Filters</a> are NSF 42, 53 and 401 certified, meaning they remove chlorine, lead, other harmful metals, and some organic contaminants like herbicides. So while you think you might be getting a good deal with 3rd party filters, and they&#39;ll claim they can remove harmful substances often by using deceptive wording, chances are they&#39;re not actually certified to do more than remove chlorine.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/m6e81u/ysk_that_not_all_water_filters_that_advertise_the/","title":"YSK that not all water filters that advertise the ability to remove lead are actually certified to do so","tags":["YouShouldKnow","reddit"],"date":"March 17, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-17T01:16:42.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-17 01:16","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"54811cbe-4805-5659-8035-fe8dd2f4dee4","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/m6e81u/ysk_that_not_all_water_filters_that_advertise_the/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/m6e81u/ysk_that_not_all_water_filters_that_advertise_the/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"YouShouldKnow","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow","author":"Chris2112","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Chris2112","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Chris2112","score":93,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"YSK，并不是所有宣传能够去除铅的滤水器都是经过认证的。","the_new_excerpt":"为什么选择YSK：如果你去购买第三方的冰箱/水过滤器替换产品。\nBrita他们会告诉你，他们可以去除有害金属，如铅，但不是。\n实际上是经过认证的，除非他们有NSF 53认证。\n\n完整的故事。\n\n我住在新泽西州的纽瓦克市 所以尽管我的家里没有铅管...
