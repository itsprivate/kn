I read a bunch of books to help me but this one really sticks out.</p>\n\n<p>Why YSK: Many people who grow up with a parent who screams at them when angry ends up doing it to friends or members of their own family when they grow up. They don&#39;t know that, for a lot of people who grew up with healthier family dynamics, it&#39;s not normal to be screamed at and can feel very scary. Screaming at someone angrily isn&#39;t necessarily abuse, but habitually screaming at someone to scare or upset them or to &#39;get your way&#39;, especially when also insulting them or cursing at them, is considered abusive. You&#39;d be surprised how many people do not know this and think screaming is normal!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/m2xzxh/ysk_that_screaming_at_people_in_your_family_is/","title":"YSK that screaming at people in your family is not normal in a lot of households, and a starting point for abuse","tags":["YouShouldKnow","reddit"],"date":"March 12, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-12T09:45:53.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-12 09:45","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"m2xzxh","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/m2xzxh/ysk_that_screaming_at_people_in_your_family_is/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/m2xzxh/ysk_that_screaming_at_people_in_your_family_is/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"YouShouldKnow","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow","author":"PettyWitch","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/PettyWitch","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"PettyWitch","score":18076,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"YSK，在很多家庭中，对你的家人大喊大叫是不正常的，也是虐待的起点。","the_new_excerpt":"编辑：如果你想推荐一本书，我推荐《如何应对》。\n阿尔伯特-伯恩斯坦的《情绪爆炸的人》。我在19岁的时候读过这本书\n试图理解为什么我爸会对我们大发雷霆，这让我意识到我\n也是走向了那条向人爆炸的道路。我看了一堆...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"YSK，在很多家庭中，對你的家人大喊大叫是不正常的，也是虐待的起點。","the_new_excerpt":"編輯：如果你想推薦一本書，我推薦《如何應對》。\n阿爾伯特-伯恩斯坦的《情緒爆炸的人》。我在19歲的時候讀過這本書\n試圖理解爲什麼我爸會對我們大發雷霆，這讓我意識到我\n也是走向了那條向人爆炸的道路。我看了一堆...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m0c6m3","excerpt":"Why YSK: It’s good to bring awareness on this topic and can hopefully help lead\nto more positive relationships.\n\nI understand kids can be very frustrating to deal with or even annoying at\ntimes.
