It could be your family, roommate, boyfriend or literally anyone. If you feel like you have to walk on eggshells every time that person is around, it&#39;s literally affecting your health. </p>\n\n<p>I read about this guy who used to have migraines multiple times in a weak when he was living with his toxic parents. He changed diets, doctors, did everything he could to get rid of them, nothing helped. When he moved to another city and lived alone, he had just one migraine in 7 months. Crazy to think how our environment affects us. Leave anyone like that, walking on eggshells is no way to live. Living with toxic people can literally kill you. Take care of your health, both physical and mental.</p>\n\n<p>Edit- Thanks for the awards. Some comments here are heartbreaking and I wish you all good health and peace 💚🤍</p>\n\n<p>For those asking for any sources: Read the book THE BODY KEEPS THE SCORE. Infact, I&#39;d suggest this book to everyone.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/lszqse/ysk_that_living_with_toxic_people_affects_not/","title":"YSK that living with toxic people affects not just your mental health but your physical health too.","tags":["YouShouldKnow","reddit"],"date":"February 26, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-26T22:54:16.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-26 22:54","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"a0720c13-df2d-592e-b0af-387f2abca09e","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/lszqse/ysk_that_living_with_toxic_people_affects_not/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/lszqse/ysk_that_living_with_toxic_people_affects_not/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"YouShouldKnow","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow","author":"khajakhaja","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/khajakhaja","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"khajakhaja","score":13414,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"YSK说，和有毒的人生活在一起，不仅会影响你的心理健康，也会影响你的身体健康。","the_new_excerpt":"为什么选择YSK：如果你有痤疮、脱发、饮食失调、偏头痛或你有痤疮、脱发、饮食失调、偏头痛或你有痤疮。\n尽管您一直在锻炼身体、吃东西，但还是觉得身体有问题。\n健康，静心，只是有整体的好习惯，检查你的环境。\n和有毒的人生活在一起会给你带来重大的健康问题。它...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"YSK說，和有毒的人生活在一起，不僅會影響你的心理健康，也會影響你的身體健康。","the_new_excerpt":"爲什麼選擇YSK：如果你有痤瘡、脫髮、飲食失調、偏頭痛或你有痤瘡、脫髮、飲食失調、偏頭痛或你有痤瘡。\n儘管您一直在鍛鍊身體、喫東西，但還是覺得身體有問題。\n健康，靜心，只是有整體的好習慣，檢查你的環境。\n和有毒的人生活在一起會給你帶來重大的健康問題。它...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-6f5966bc-40fd-50f1-bb55-050a13840f9e","excerpt":"Why YSK: there could be a simple solution to fixing a very common problem.
