We&#39;re also coming into spring when those little assholes are more active.</p>\n\n<p>My husband is allergic to wasps and a couple years ago we found in our large Rhododendron bush in our yard a bald-faced hornets nest. It was very well hidden, and was about the size of a volleyball. An in-law gave me the number and email address to a local man who will remove it for free (as long as it hasn’t been sprayed with anything yet). We contacted him immediately and within two days he came and removed the hive.</p>\n\n<p>He sells these wasps to companies that use the venom to create allergy shots for people like my husband.</p>\n\n<p>Why YSK: Before you spray, pay hundreds of dollars to an exterminator to remove them, or risk getting stung or chased down the street by a particularly pissed off group of wasps, you can probably find a person in your area that will take it away for free.
