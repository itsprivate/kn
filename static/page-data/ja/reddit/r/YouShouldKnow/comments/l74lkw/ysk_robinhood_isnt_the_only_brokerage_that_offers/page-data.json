However, commission-free trading is a much more standard practice than it was a few years ago. While Robinhood may deserve credit for this, it doesn&#39;t mean you have to stick with them.</strong></p>\n\n<p>You&#39;ve probably heard about their response to the Gamestop incident, so I won&#39;t reiterate it. However, this isn&#39;t the first time Robinhood&#39;s business practices have sparked controversy. If you&#39;re not informed enough to be trusted with what freedom they <em>do</em> give you, you have other options, like a robo-investor. And if you&#39;re an active and informed trader, or you just really want to blow your money on GME stock to make a point, you&#39;re not even in their target market.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ll refrain from recommending a particular service, as I&#39;m not a professional and it&#39;s <em>extremely</em> important to read the fine print. Some brokerages may offer commission-free trades as a temporary promotion, and some will offset the reduced cost by charging customers in less obvious ways, a practice Robinhood has been accused of. You should <em>always</em> know what you&#39;re getting into.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: A few more things: First of all, a lot of people are angry at Robinhood right now. I&#39;m one of them. However, please don&#39;t impulsively sell stocks or close your accounts without knowing how long the liquidation process takes, what you&#39;re gonna do with your money, and what a &quot;wash sale&quot; is.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, there are a lot of false as well as confusing reports about the Gamestop incident, including which companies are doing what, so be careful when trying to piece it together.</p>\n\n<p>And finally, RIP my inbox.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/l74lkw/ysk_robinhood_isnt_the_only_brokerage_that_offers/","title":"YSK: Robinhood isn't the only brokerage that offers commission-free stock trading","tags":["YouShouldKnow","reddit"],"date":"January 29, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-29T06:59:05.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-29 06:59","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"899bd8c2-372e-50c1-aa04-a7440954fd05","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/l74lkw/ysk_robinhood_isnt_the_only_brokerage_that_offers/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/l74lkw/ysk_robinhood_isnt_the_only_brokerage_that_offers/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"YouShouldKnow","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow","author":"David_Arafel","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/David_Arafel","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"David_Arafel","score":16294,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"YSK: Robinhood并不是唯一一家提供免佣金股票交易的经纪公司。","the_new_excerpt":"为什么是YSK：很多人加入Robinhood是为了避免佣金费用。\n由其他经纪公司收取。然而，免佣金交易是一种更\n比几年前更标准的做法。虽然Robinhood可能值得\n功劳，这并不意味着你必须坚持... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"YSK: Robinhood並不是唯一一家提供免佣金股票交易的經紀公司。","the_new_excerpt":"爲什麼是YSK：很多人加入Robinhood是爲了避免佣金費用。\n由其他經紀公司收取。然而，免佣金交易是一種更\n比幾年前更標準的做法。雖然Robinhood可能值得\n功勞，這並不意味着你必須堅持... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-e4f8052d-bca9-55ca-843b-5793456586f2","excerpt":"NOTE: This only applies to potentially non-profitable degrees (typically arts\nand sciences).
