EM is important for all relationships, not just the client-consultant one.</p>\n\n<p>When you are planning to do something, whether for work or in your personal life, be honest with yourself and any other parties about what can be done within a given timeframe/budget. It may lead to disappointment and possibly even you losing the project, but it’s better to weed those situations out at the beginning rather than be stuck with an impossible task that you can’t deliver on. If you fail to deliver after agreeing to unreasonable terms, it’s all on you. At that point, your reputation will take a much bigger hit than if you had just been honest at the beginning.</p>\n\n<p>This sounds so obvious, but I can’t tell you how many times I’ve seen other consultants land in hot water with clients because they promised something could be done in 4 weeks when they know it usually takes 6-8. Only twice in my career did a client walk because I was honest with them about what could be done, and I believe I (and my firm) dodged a bullet in both cases.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/l4psn3/ysk_that_expectation_management_is_a_crucial_but/","title":"YSK that Expectation Management is a Crucial but Underrated Skill","tags":["YouShouldKnow","reddit"],"date":"January 26, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-26T07:58:56.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-26 07:58","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"ffa2b06e-a6cd-54a8-854b-8c72c7669133","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/l4psn3/ysk_that_expectation_management_is_a_crucial_but/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/l4psn3/ysk_that_expectation_management_is_a_crucial_but/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"YouShouldKnow","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow","author":"felix_mateo","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/felix_mateo","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"felix_mateo","score":11009,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"YSK认为期望管理是一项重要但被低估的技能","the_new_excerpt":"为什么选择YSK：作为一名职业顾问，我观察到绝大多数的\n不成功的项目不是因为任何技术原因而失败的。\n的缺点，而是因为不良的期望管理（EM）。EM很重要\n对于所有的关系，而不仅仅是客户与顾问的关系。\n\n当你...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"YSK認爲期望管理是一項重要但被低估的技能","the_new_excerpt":"爲什麼選擇YSK：作爲一名職業顧問，我觀察到絕大多數的\n不成功的項目不是因爲任何技術原因而失敗的。\n的缺點，而是因爲不良的期望管理（EM）。EM很重要\n對於所有的關係，而不僅僅是客戶與顧問的關係。\n\n當你...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-a777f873-0778-5e93-82f9-91937fe6beee","excerpt":"Why YSK: Because promising drugs developed and approved in other countries take\nyears to get approved in the US, years some US patients with serious conditions\nmay not have.\n\nMany people with conditions like ALS, Multiple Sclerosis or certain cancers who\ndon't see improvements or a slowing of the…","slug":"/reddit/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/l4rllg/ysk_that_you_can_legally_import_medicines_that/","title":"YSK that you can legally import medicines that are not approved in the USA - FDA allows it under limited conditions","date":"January 26, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"YSK，你可以合法地进口未在美国批准的药品--FDA允许在有限的条件下进口。","the_new_excerpt":"为什么是YSK：因为在其他国家开发并获得批准的有前途的药物需要\n年才能在美国获得批准，年有些美国患者病情严重\n可能没有。\n\n许多患有像ALS、多发性硬化症或某些癌症的人，他们可能没有。\n看不到改善或放缓的... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"YSK，你可以合法地進口未在美國批准的藥品--FDA允許在有限的條件下進口。","the_new_excerpt":"爲什麼是YSK：因爲在其他國家開發並獲得批准的有前途的藥物需要\n年才能在美國獲得批准，年有些美國患者病情嚴重\n可能沒有。\n\n許多患有像ALS、多發性硬化症或某些癌症的人，他們可能沒有。\n看不到改善或放緩的... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-554fc076-c5d7-5294-926d-f88f425a764d","excerpt":"Why YSK: I consider loaned money basically lost money because someone can have\nall the plans in the world to pay you back and then when time comes to collect,\nthey are no where to be seen.
