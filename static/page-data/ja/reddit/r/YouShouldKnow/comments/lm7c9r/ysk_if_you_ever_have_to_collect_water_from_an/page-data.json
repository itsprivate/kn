However, boiling water doesn&#39;t remove chemicals or heavy metals collected in the water supply. To make sure that you are only drinking water, it needs to be <strong>distilled</strong>. </p>\n\n<p>There are a number of methods to distill water, but the simplest is described <a href=\"https://www.thoughtco.com/making-distilled-water-609427\">here</a>. Basically you boil a small pot within a big pot and turn the big lid upside down over top of the big pot. The steam collects on the lid and cools just enough to fall into the small pot. As long as the water isn&#39;t high enough to just flow into the small pot, the water that collects inside the small pot is safe to drink. </p>\n\n<p>I figure with a lot people going without plumbing right now, this might be a concern for some people. Good luck!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/lm7c9r/ysk_if_you_ever_have_to_collect_water_from_an/","title":"YSK If you ever have to collect water from an outside source (river, stream, lake, etc.), then you should distill the water before drinking it.
