I had to use a combination of mittens and chemical hand warmers for winter, because my hands still wouldn&amp;#39;t stay warm in regular gloves. I thought this was just a miserable quirk that I couldn&amp;#39;t change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it came up at a doctor&amp;#39;s appointment randomly, the doc said that this is classic Raynaud&amp;#39;s Phenomenon (previously I thought that just meant purple hands, and mine were never as purple as the pictures), and that the issue with cold is absolutely treatable! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was put on an extremely low dose of a calcium channel blocker (hopefully &lt;a href=&quot;https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/331197-treatment&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is an okay citation) to open my blood vessels a bit, and the doc said that alternatives are available if that isn&amp;#39;t enough. So far, though, I&amp;#39;ve have huge improvements in numbness and have been able to go without gloves in fall weather, which I could not do before!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the bottom line - if you struggle with something like this, YOU ARE NOT DOOMED TO BE MISERABLE. It&amp;#39;s worth bringing up to a medical professional!&lt;/p&gt;

It helps if we can accept other people&amp;#39;s silences as &amp;quot;time to think&amp;quot; instead of &amp;quot;judgement&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;disagreement.&amp;quot; Some of us tend to chatter when we&amp;#39;re nervous or whenever there&amp;#39;s a lull in the conversation, but filling the silence just clutters the conversation and interrupts whatever thoughts the speaker is putting together internally.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should also know that staying silent yourself from time to time during a conversation can give you a micro-dose of social power -- use it wisely, though, or it could be mistaken for arrogance or manipulation (because &amp;quot;the silent treatment&amp;quot; is juvenile and unproductive). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tbc, I&amp;#39;m not suggesting long, uncomfortable, squirm-in-your-chair silences -- but pauses that are long enough to give you and others time to think before replying (something we don&amp;#39;t do enough). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many appropriate times to take a silent pause during a conversation. For example, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Silence is quite effective when you&amp;#39;ve made a statement but someone wants to argue with you about it, especially if you didn&amp;#39;t say it to start a debate, such as a decision you&amp;#39;ve made or an opinion you hold. Your silence holds firm and solidifies your statement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Silence is also appropriate after asking someone a question, to give them time to think &amp;amp; process their answer. Consider, they may be going over several possible answers in their minds and need time to think, although we might feel impatient because we were already prepared with our question. Also, it&amp;#39;s not necessary to chatter on about the question while they&amp;#39;re thinking about it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another useful time for silence is while listening to someone talk, which includes silencing your thoughts and mindfully listening instead of planning the next thing you want to say.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; It&amp;#39;s also respectful to be quiet for a few moments after someone has finished what they want to say about a topic, making sure they&amp;#39;re finished and that you&amp;#39;re digesting what they&amp;#39;ve said. Taking time before speaking shows that you were listening rather than waiting impatiently for your turn to speak.&lt;/li&gt;

You can avoid having to replace your windows, bags, and other stolen valuables by taking your bag with you or putting it in your trunk instead – the few seconds it takes to do so is worth as much as what you paid for it, if not more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To a thief, a bag in a car is full of valuable stuff at best, and a new bag to cram other stolen stuff into at worst. Even if it looks empty, it could still have a laptop, a gun, a camera, a Nintendo Switch, or any number of other expensive, pawnable things in it. If it&amp;#39;s a designer bag, the bag itself may be worth selling. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why YSK: While people not yielding when they should yield is much more common, several times now since moving out to California when I&amp;#39;ve been waiting to pull out from a parking lot I&amp;#39;ve had people hard brake on busy roads in order to let me &amp;quot;safely&amp;quot; make a left hand turn. The first time it happened I was taken off guard, but no one was behind the car that randomly decided to yield so it was ultimately fine. The second time on the other hand, multiple cars had to slam on their brakes to accommodate for the driver who randomly decided to stop in the middle of the road to let me turn. Now if I was edging out into the road, looking like I was going to dart in front of the incoming traffic, I could understand why people might slow down or even yield just to be safe, but on both occasions I was at a full stop and not in the main road at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, I know you&amp;#39;re trying to be polite but you&amp;#39;re just making the road more dangerous for other drivers!&lt;/p&gt;

I make it a personal goal to give 10 compliments per day either in person or online BUT I very very rarely compliment men due to past trauma from the hands of a man and now I have a general fear of them. I am in therapy and working on it. Anyway, today at the gym, a gentleman had a really cool shirt on that said “train everything” and it caught my eye. I didn’t say anything because I was scared I’d be seen as flirting or he’d see it as an excuse to flirt with ME and I didn’t want that. So I stayed silent. But, when I ran into him again at the water fountain I shoved my fears down and said &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hey I really like your shirt!!! And it fits you so well!” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AND MY GOD YALL!!! The SMILE I got from this man! He was absolutely BEAMING. He just said “wow thank you so much!” And that was it. I couldn’t believe how incredibly happy he looked. I’ve seen that look from women before but not nearly as drastic. He looked like a starving man who was just offered a steak dinner. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It made me realize that while I am still very scared of men from my past trauma, 99% of them are just humans who deserve compliments just like women BUT… they don’t get them very often. Like it’s difficult for a cis man to compliment another man, especially on his body or attire, because it might be seen as &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;GASP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; “gay”. And while that is an issue that also needs addressed, I think we, as women, can do our part too. Of course always stay safe and trust your gut, but let’s compliment some men together!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Helmets are filled with what&amp;#39;s called EPS foam (expanded polystyrene). EPS is a very light but stiff foam similar to styrofoam. Once you deform or crush it, it stays that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From epsindustry.org:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike other types of padding, EPS foam does not bounce back after a compressing impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means it&amp;#39;s better at absorbing impact than a softer foam, which is good for protecting your head. But after an impact, that foam is crushed at that spot and no longer able to absorb any impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From off.road.cc:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to tiny impact after tiny impact over time, the EPS will gradually lose its volume making it less able to deal with the energy in the unfortunate event of an impact. Of course the more the helmet is used the more it will deteriorate, so one rule for all does not work here, but three years is a good guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Replace your bike helmets after every big fall.
Replace your skateboard/ski/snowboard helmet after a few big falls.
Someone let me know about motorcycle helmets, I assume you wanna replace that after 1 fall.
Replace your helmets every 3 years even if you have no falls or minor falls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Some great extra notes from the comments:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bike helmets are designs for 1 fall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sturdier helmets like for skating or snowboarding can take a few more falls.&lt;/li&gt;

Shortsighted HR departments are increasingly using this software as the leading indicator of your value to the company &lt;em&gt;above all else.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See the bottom of this post for things you can do to protect yourself from this idiocy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why I wrote this:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was shocked at the response when I mentioned this concept in a prior comment.  Many people this affects are wholly unaware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, someone I know was fired FOR CAUSE due to their &amp;quot;lack of engagement, and unprofessional conduct.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a little insight into what that means by way of some work buddies, and personal review of the software that was used because her boss is a narcissistic assclown who was so proud of himself that he showed me the tools that were used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This all began because the software on her computer flagged a word in a &amp;quot;private&amp;quot; Teams chat with a colleague which started the boss down a vindictive road of parallel construction - eventually lead to her termination.  That word was &amp;quot;ass.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A quick summary:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Bossware&amp;quot; has been something companies could use for over a decade, but the bastards have integrated other Orwellian stuff like facial recognition to monitor your mood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/06/inside-invasive-secretive-bossware-tracking-workers&quot;&gt;Here is an in-depth article about it from EFF.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theladders.com/wp-content/uploads/02-How-Employers-Monitor-Employees.png&quot;&gt;This is a one-pager about it.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5JiyAfT.png&quot;&gt;This is a comparison of a handful of bossware&amp;#39;s features.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theladders.com/career-advice/bossware-report-when-wfh-means-the-boss-is-watching-what-bosses-see-how-to-prevent-it&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12% of all firms have already installed it (16% at larger firms), and 8% already plan to implement it (11% at larger firms). Tracking software like this has an ominously William Gibson-esque nickname: bossware.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, bosses may use unpublicized features of their corporate email package to look out for trigger words in your emails. Or they may use dedicated bossware to check that you’re actually at your computer when you say you are.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employers can install hidden software on your device that tracks your movements via GPS, all SMS messages and other messaging app usage, and can even record calls and Skype interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is a nonzero chance that:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your webcam is taking periodic screenshots, or even video of you and your surroundings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your mic is &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; &amp;quot;hot.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your calls are &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; recorded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your chats and emails are &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; scraped for keywords.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your keystrokes, and mouse movements are &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; tracked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your &amp;quot;engagement&amp;quot; is &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; monitored to the millisecond.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I emphasize the word always because software doesn&amp;#39;t sleep.  Humans don&amp;#39;t see everything at all times.  The key here is that a human is flagged for nonsensical things by the software, and that human can really pick you apart from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some basic stuff you can do to protec&amp;#39; ya&amp;#39; neck:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Shut your computer down after work.  A device that&amp;#39;s off has very low risk of snooping during time you don&amp;#39;t even get paid for &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reconsider having personal sidechats with your coworkers on company hardware.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cover your webcam when not in use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get your own headset with a hardware mute button and leave it muted until you need to speak.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move your mouse if you are idle during a listening task like an all hands call.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type things frequently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#39;t browse anything that isn&amp;#39;t 100% work related on company hardware.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All else fails - get another job, and let your boss know why after the new contract is signed.&lt;/li&gt;

Any drive over 10mins I would feel nauseous and anything over 30 I would usually throw up. But a super helpful tip I learned to combat it is looking straight ahead, this helps balance the fluids in your ear that otherwise would cause car sickness. It also helps to stare at something far ahead. Since it is far it seems to move less and is less visually nauseating. However car sickness medication can do wonders as-well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why YSK: sometimes you get carsick when you normally don’t and need to not throw up. Or you get carsick often and need help. Or you forgot the medicine you normally take. &lt;/p&gt;

If something goes wrong (which it does), and you are caught in the crossfire, you will die. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule #1: &lt;strong&gt;The semi always wins. Always.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule #2: When on the freeway, keep your distance from the semi. As a rule of thumb, if you can read the license plate, you&amp;#39;re too close. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule #3: When passing, do so as quickly as possible. If they are passing you, slow down. If you are passing them, speed up. Driving next to a semi is one of the most dangerous places you can be for multiple reasons, and therefore is a place you don&amp;#39;t want to be. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule #4: When lane-shifting in front of the semi, make sure that you do so at a safe distance. If you shift too close, you may scare the driver, and they may swerve to avoid you. In general, if you can see both of the semi&amp;#39;s headlights in your side mirror, you&amp;#39;re at a safe distance to move. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule #5: The semi has very large blind spots. Don&amp;#39;t be in them. They can&amp;#39;t check their blind spots very well, so a lane shift may very well shove you off the road. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule #6: Sometimes, semis will need to take &amp;quot;Wide turns&amp;quot;, which essentially means that they can&amp;#39;t use the rightmost lane to take a right turn-they need to move one over. If you are at an intersection and have a semi next to you, don&amp;#39;t start moving as soon as the light changes-wait to see if the semi makes the first move, and confirm where they are going before making yours.&lt;/p&gt;

I have recently been receiving e-mails claiming that my account has been compromised or that they have noticed some suspicious activity on my account  or whatever else these scammers come up with. If you open their e-mail it looks legitimate, but it&amp;#39;s not. There are a lot of ways you can tell that an e-mail is a scam and if you want you can click &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-recognize-and-avoid-phishing-scams&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to find out more about how there phishing attacks work and recognize them so that you don&amp;#39;t fall victim to these scams.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What they usually want is for you to log-in so this way they can steal your information and then they can do whatever they want with it. If they steal, for example, your log-in information for your Amazon account, they will try and see if you have a credit card attached to your account and they end up stealing it. If you want to see more on how these scammers operate, there are a lot of YouTube videos that expose these scammers, I&amp;#39;d recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO9mWvJAugQ&quot;&gt;this person&lt;/a&gt; because he explains in-depth how they operate and he even manages to hack the scammers and scare them by showing their webcam or calling them by their real name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, be careful on the internet, don&amp;#39;t trust unfamiliar sources and don&amp;#39;t open suspicious e-mails. Other ways you can protect yourself online is the use of better passwords and using different passwords for every website. You can read more about how to create better passwords &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/enterprise/cloud-security/how-to-create-a-strong-password-you-actually-remember/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;#39;s my hope that people who suffer from chronic insomnia or issues falling asleep might be able to use this technique to sleep more consistently. I also think it may prove a useful tool for people who suffer constantly from issues like anxiety, stress, and panic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To perform the technique, first expel all air from your lungs, then do a deep inhale that lasts 4 seconds. With your lungs full of air, hold your breath for 7 seconds. Finally, exhale through your mouth (through your lips, making a whooshing sound) for 8 seconds. The ratio between the time of each step is more important than counting seconds accurately, so if you have trouble holding your breath, timing like 2, 3.5, and 4 might work too, although 4-7-8 is the most common recommendation and seems to elicit the most success. If you repeat the steps 2 or 3 times, your body should enter &amp;quot;rest and digest&amp;quot; mode, which may help you fall asleep quickly if you&amp;#39;re already in good sleeping conditions (comfortable, laying down, dark and quiet) or promote relaxation if you&amp;#39;re stressed or anxious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interacting with a closed and supposedly static population results in very rigid world views and misconceptions that make you close minded even though the new information may actually be in your favour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;——&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Societies pass on information to younger generations through education and interactions with them. This creates a thesaurus of “common knowledge”. The problem with “common knowledge” passed down from generations is that it is often filled with misconceptions and misunderstandings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the outcome of multiple people with varying degrees of understanding and experiences providing a take, and you as a receiver only have a partial point of view of that information, and of the person disseminating it, so it is difficult for you to understand that person’s biases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, people tend to coalesce to communities of similar thoughts and behaviour. This is called “intellectual inbreeding”, where ideas are rehashed amongst a community and over time get perverted because the community doesn’t get exposed to new information or someone willing to provide counter arguments. This is such a major problem in science that top universities often don’t accept their own graduates (PhD or not) in positions and look for candidates from other universities, though exceptions exist. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, due to the brain’s plasticity, disseminating the same ideas as our group reinforces those ideas and causes them to become very rigid and fundamental parts of our world model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we have a very rigid world view and we encounter a person who subscribes to fundamentally different ideas, our world view gets shaken exactly because it is very rigid, and we become unable to accept the new ideas regardless of correctness because our brain interprets the new information as an attack to itself and reality. This “attach”  physically manifests as narrow-mindedness in the brain and prevents us from accepting them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can you do about it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cultivate a process in your brain that keeps challenging the status quo and actively and honestly tries to find mistakes in it. Read books/listen to podcasts, and have discussions with people of opposing views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep asking, what if I am wrong, why do I have this belief, and suppose a malevolent person disseminated this idea, what could they gain from it?&lt;/p&gt;

It isn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, how do I do that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is this common misconception that just because you are older and the brain doesn’t “learn as fast”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this is true by some regards, kids don’t learn in the same way as adults do. Kids learn by imitating actions from their environment, they can do that because their brain has significantly more synapses(=connections between brain cells) than adults, so it’s easier for the brain to find the right pathway and reinforce it while pruning “wrong” synapses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, adults have preexisting synapses that have been reinforced for a long time and so it’s significantly harder to learn by imitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But adults also have a significantly better world model (=understanding of the world), and significantly more developed frontal cortex (=rational thinking and control of functions and behaviour). This means that by employing pre existing knowledge and understanding you can attain a much better understanding of the skill you are trying to learn than kids. This, then means that you can explore and generate new “actions” and behaviour much better than kids because you have better understanding of what is going on under it. By doing that consciously you will be able to turn the actually “correct” and “high quality” conscious actions into subconscious actions that are second nature. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, even learning itself and creativity are skills that can be trained for (as a grad student with publications from undergrad, and a lot of original work, who has ventured into other fields in her own time because she found it interesting, I recommend the Feynman method with flashcards and extensive notes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brain is a very strong pattern matching and creative computer. It’s a shame that many people live with regrets of not learning to play instruments or some other skill. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some authors that I can recommend:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Kahneman (eg. “Thinking fast and slow”)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  David Eagleman (eg. “Livewired”, ”the brain”)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Robert Sapolsky (eg “Behave”, “why zebras don’t get ulcers”)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;  Lieberman and Long (The molecule of more)&lt;/li&gt;

Completely locked down with browser management extensions and admin blocks. For gosh-sake sometimes I just wanna scroll Reddit or watch Twitch when there&amp;#39;s nothing else going on. And for those of you who a school Chromebook is the only access you have to internet, you&amp;#39;re going to want to take a break and relax sometimes. Without further delay, here&amp;#39;s how to bypass website blocks on school Chromebooks on which website &amp;quot;security&amp;quot; is managed by extensions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1: Google search the website you want to visit. Don&amp;#39;t click the link yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2: In the top right corner you should see three vertical dots. Click that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3: Head over to more tools and click task manager&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4: End the processes associated with your Chromebook&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;security&amp;quot; (e.g. cisco umbrella extension) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5: After that, quickly click the website you want to visit. Do this fast as the &amp;quot;security&amp;quot; processes reinstate themselves and you may have to spam &amp;#39;end process&amp;#39; multiple times for the request to go through. Refresh the page and end &amp;quot;security&amp;quot; extensions as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the website loads in, you should not have to spam close the &amp;quot;security&amp;quot; extensions, and most of the website features should run as normal. You should also be able to visit those websites in the future without having to complete the process above. The only exception Ive seen where consistent buffering occurs is crunchyroll and the Reddit media player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps some people :D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: This solution only works if your school didn&amp;#39;t block task manager. If they did, you gotta resort to a dual boot process off an external drive if your processor supports windows/linux&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t exactly know the process, but I&amp;#39;m sure you could find a youtube video that shows you how to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AMD and Intel processors support both Windows 10 and some versions of Linux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you to &lt;a href=&quot;/u/enderwiggin42&quot;&gt;u/enderwiggin42&lt;/a&gt; for the info!&lt;/p&gt;

For example in a fight or (sport)accident. If you don’t follow these steps it reduces the chance of survival of your tooth drastically. When it dies it becomes brown-ish and it has a short life span.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A tooth is a living part of your body. The inner part of the tooth is called the pulpa. The pulpa consists of nerves, bloodvessels, stemcells and this can die. When this happens the lifespan of the tooth is short (around &amp;lt;10 years) and will eventually require an implant or a bridge because it will fall out. When your tooth gets knocked out (or you see one getting knocked out) it is important to follow these steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;pick the tooth up by the crown (chewing surface). Never touch the root! These are surrounded by specialised cells which can be destroyed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspect the tooth: is it covered in dirt? 
—&amp;gt; yes: rinse with milk or your own(!) saliva. By pouring the milk on it or spitting your saliva on it. (Clean drinkable (not tap water)) water works too. Still don’t touch or wipe the root and don’t use chemicals like soap!
If not this step can be skipped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preserve the tooth in a save environment.
There are several ways to do this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a. (Best option) - look at the tooth. What is the front and what is the back? Place it back correctly and hold it in place with a rag (or something  soft which is similar, like toilet paper or a piece of clothing). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b. When this is not possible because the person is either a child (because they can swallow it) unconcious, jaw is broken, or you don’t know where it belongs because several teeth are out: collect saliva of the person it belongs to (!) in a clean cup (or something similar which is clean like a cap of a waterbottle) and put it gently in there. It should be completely covered in saliva (blood doesn’t matter). Milk works too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;c. Put it in your mouth between the cheek and your teeth with your mouth closed. Don’t touch it with your tongue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contact a dentist. He needs to prepare an emergency. You need to go there asap. The dentist will clean the tooth, put it back and spalk it temporarily. This is not expensive (ask if this concerns you). After a few weeks you need to go back to see if the tooth survived. Often more than not it will survive when the above steps are done correctly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Important:
Never put back baby teeth. This might damage the gums. Not sure? Follow 3b or 3c.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only the person where the knocked out  belongs to can use his own saliva to rinse or clean it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to go to the dentist as soon as possible (within an hour)&lt;/p&gt;

Sounds silly and fun, and an impromptu suds dance party will just take a little extra water to clean up so no harm, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fountains use specialized water pumps which are designed to keep lubricated even when in constant use with plain water. Unfortunately, the soap works to destroy the seals and strip the pump motors of their protective lubrication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one major reason there are very few public water fountains anymore. One or two attacks, and most cash-strapped facilities opt to drain the fountain and let the thing rot until they can afford to dismantle it altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fountains on the Lee Clarion University campus in Cleveland, Tennessee are historically prone to vandalism. One particular event in August 2010 cost the university $1,000 in materials alone to drain the fountain, clean all surfaces, chemically remove the suds and flush the pipes, not to mention add important chemicals back in to prevent algae growth and keep the water crystal clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently in July 2014, a soaped fountain in Eau Claire, Wisconsin kept city workers busy for days cleaning up the mess. Crews had to clean out the whole fountain, backwash the filters, rinse, wash and repeat multiple times before all the soap was cleared out of the system. It took hours of manpower and several days before the fountain was back up and running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.groundsguys.com/blog/2015/august/you-ve-been-soaped-now-what-/&quot;&gt;the Grounds Guys&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a myth purported from the 60s and 70s, car engine technology and oil technology has evolved greatly since then and engines go longer between oil changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most cars in the US have engines that are used worldwide. For example, Ford engines used in cars in American are manufactured and used worldwide. Oil change intervals for these same engines are 10,000 miles +&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the go-to site for most ebooks. Some of the engineering textbooks comes with the solution manual as well. Searching for the title + &amp;quot;solution manual&amp;quot; will give you some results. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Ch36650lut10n5 (cheggsolutions)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A website which has textbook solutions ripped from chegg. It has quite a lot of books and free, no need to sign up or give any credentials. You can find many textbook solutions that are not on libgen or zlibrary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Zlibrary&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is another site where you can try if you can&amp;#39;t find it in Library Genesis.
You may need an account if you exceed the download limit. If you do not like to use your personal email, you can opt to use a temporary mail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Slader&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for textbook solutions for free, check Slader. You have to sign up to access materials, after that you can access many solution manuals written by teachers and professors. 
They recently installed a limit, trying to make access to answers a paid service unfortunately. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Studylib&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the name itself says it’s like a library, where you can have a large number of assignments and solutions. You can also share your notes with your friends which would help them to solve the problems. It will provide you with a solution for all the subjects. You can also upload your documents and find the solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Pdfdrive&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An online PDF search engine that lets you search, preview and download PDFs. According to the site as of right now, there are over 75 million eBooks, magazines, articles, and more that are indexed and discoverable directly on PDF Drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sci-Hub&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great place for finding published journal/conference papers that are (usually) paywalled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;AudioBookBay&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If what you want is audiobooks then audiobookbay is the go-to place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck on your new semester everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try not to use these terms and explain what you mean in plain language.   Posting “that is a Strawman argument” adds nothing.  Posting “people don’t believe X like you said, they believe various things from Y to Z, which makes your argument wrong” says what you actually mean and allows for ongoing discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no term to describe it, but the practice of labelling every view you disagree with as a logical fallacy is definitely a rhetorical fallacy that should be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the first thing you need to know about how to avoid hitting an animal is to expect the animal to be on the road before it&amp;#39;s on the road. complacency is the thing that kills most animals that wander onto a road. COMPLACENCY is also the thing that kills most HUMANS on the road. imagine you&amp;#39;re just driving, chilling, listening to music, and suddenly there&amp;#39;s some random animal in your way and because this is such an oddity in your life your brain does not come up with a solution quickly enough. if you simulate the scenario in your mind before it happens you will be able to react accordingly, minimizing potential losses without risk to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-if you drive at night this is relatively simple. most animal and vehicle crashes occur between the hours of 5PM and midnight. be on the lookout for animals if you drive during these times, but &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; if you&amp;#39;re driving while it&amp;#39;s dark out. and remember not to limit your view to what&amp;#39;s immediately in front of you. you should be aiming to look down the road 10 to 15 seconds ahead of your vehicle in order to avoid any last minute moves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this is the thing you need to know about animals on the road: 99% of the time you encounter an animal on the road, the animal will stop in the middle of the road and/or turn around after noticing your car. the headlights confuse their dark-adjusted eyes and signal that there is imminent danger, and their brain tells them to retreat. you must anticipate this. to see this for yourself, if you look up &amp;quot;russ lepage deer&amp;quot; on google you&amp;#39;ll be directed to a video that shows a close call with an automated tesla driver and a deer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(I would like to mention that the vehicle in this video made a lane change that I would consider too sharp for comfort, and making a split second decision to switch lanes like that is not ideal. this is not a demonstration, but it is some footage for you to get yourself acquainted with the idea of having an animal stuck in your headlights because it is a textbook encounter and should better prepare you for the situation. do not try to replicate the technique shown here. instead, read on.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so, animals don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s on the other side of the road. they only know the area they came from. when they see your scary car, their instinct is to go back to safety. which means they&amp;#39;ll literally spin around and go back, and this will even happen if they&amp;#39;ve already safely made it to the other side of the road. all animals are guilty of this. raccoons, foxes, deer, cats, squirrels, it doesn&amp;#39;t matter. in a pinch, they will always go back to the side of the road they entered from. they will not move forward into an unknown area after realizing they&amp;#39;re in danger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&amp;#39;the maneuver&amp;#39;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;identify animal in your field of vision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;take your foot off of the accelerator pedal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;switch lanes if possible in a controlled manner. do not act with haste. you must not make any sudden or sharp movements. if you are close to the animal, you want to switch to the lane that they came from. if you are far away or very close, do not switch lanes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;always slow down. if you are switching lanes, begin to slow down halfway into your transition from one side of the road to the other. do not brake and switch lanes at the same time. do not slam the brakes. do not brake in a way that would cause your vehicle to skid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;on switching lanes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;~8&lt;/strong&gt; seconds seconds of time to react: in the video I referenced, it is a close call. but if this was in reality, you can clearly see the deer coming a mile away. the correct choice in that instance would be to simply slow down upon spotting the deer and alerting the animal and drivers behind you that something is up by hitting your car horn. no need to switch lanes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~&lt;strong&gt;5&lt;/strong&gt; seconds of time to react: in an instance where you have less time to react to the animal where it is directly in front of you, you are looking to switch lanes so that you pass the animal before it is making the active decision to turn around. the animal is also more likely to make a better decision if it can see the trajectory of your vehicle. it cannot properly see your trajectory if you are heading straight towards it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt; seconds of time to react: if you ever have a very short amount of time to react to an animal on the road unfortunately the best course of action is to slow down as much as possible without losing control of your vehicle, drive straight, and brace yourself for impact. do not attempt to change the trajectory of your vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(note that these numbers are just approximations. I&amp;#39;m not a driving expert. I am only trying to help you make the decision to switch lanes for yourself)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;tips:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;constantly check your blind spot and your left/right mirrors&lt;/strong&gt; as you are driving so you can prematurely know if you&amp;#39;re able to switch lanes on the fly if necessary. this is a helpful driving tip in general and you can avoid vehicle collisions this way as well. you may need to react quickly and not have time to check for cars on the other lane. this does not mean recklessly switch lanes without looking. it means that if you know for certain there are no cars in your way, you will be able to use the other lane to your advantage if the need arises.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;always slow down&lt;/strong&gt; if you identify an obstacle in your path (such as an animal, or another car, or a human being) there is no reason to ever not slow down. do not slam the breaks. just slow down like you normally would in a timely manner. the slower you are going, the more control you have over your vehicle. if you crash into a massive animal such as a moose or a large buck, the faster you are going the more likely you are to suffer a fatal collision. with moose, it is not much different than crashing into another vehicle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;combine tip #1 and #2.&lt;/strong&gt; just make sure that this is not done in a panic. it must be a calculated maneuver. if you make too sharp of a turn and your brakes are engaged too aggressively you could flip your car or lose control of your vehicle and spiral out of control, and kill or injure yourself and other drivers around you. and just to reiterate what I&amp;#39;ve said before, don&amp;#39;t begin to brake until you are at least halfway into your lane change. just make sure you take your foot off the accelerator before doing anything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;do not swerve&lt;/strong&gt;. swerving is a last ditch effort and extremely dangerous. if you are going to change your trajectory to avoid an incoming collision, you must do it in a similar manner as if you were turning to switch lanes. any abrupt changes to the steering wheel at high speeds will severely and negatively impact the stability of your vehicle. this is why the previously mentioned tips are so useful. if you practice them you should not ever feel the need to swerve. animals do not usually run onto the road so spontaneously that you would need to swerve, rather we react so slowly to these situations that we may impulsively feel like swerving because we ran out of time, failed to make a decision, and panicked. on the other hand people may panic and decide to crash into an animal that they could have avoided if they were better prepared. you should expect to have around 5 seconds of time to react to an animal that has suddenly tried to cross the road, on average. 5 seconds is enough time to make a decision and execute it while on the road, provided that you were paying attention and not drifting off while manning a vehicle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;stay the speed limit while driving at night&lt;/strong&gt;. animals will not be able to react properly to anything that is going significantly faster than your average wildlife predator. if you&amp;#39;re driving in a 65mph zone, drive 65mph. it&amp;#39;s night time. you are in no rush to get home. don&amp;#39;t put animal lives in jeopardy in order to save yourself a meaningless amount of time. speed inhibits control of the vehicle. the faster you&amp;#39;re going, the longer it takes to slow down and the more vulnerable your vehicle&amp;#39;s stability is to sudden movements, and the more likely you are to get in an accident and/or run over an animal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;every time you get out of the driveway always go and personally seek out your surroundings&lt;/strong&gt; to check for animals or people around you before you get in the car, even if you live in a populated neighborhood. it is not uncommon to run over a baby duck, baby rabbit, kitten, or frog while backing out of a driveway, and they are too small for you to notice them in your mirrors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like everyone to remind everyone to never forget how powerful a vehicle is and how weak living things are in comparison. as the years go by you get used to these machines. complacency is a killer. do not ever get used to driving a vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It experienced driver knows how to handle a dog aggressive or not and you&amp;#39;re insistence that they are friendly and won&amp;#39;t do anything typically is what leads to drivers being bitten and we are required to report when we are bitten which could mean your dog can get put on a vicious dog list and/or put down which is something we all want to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So unless you were there to hold back your dog and introduce them to a delivery driver either keep them inside or chained up to avoid any incidents so that you can get your package because it is well within the driver&amp;#39;s right to refuse the delivery if they believe a dog is dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure everyone&amp;#39;s safe, no one&amp;#39;s going to get hurt, and do what you can to introduce your dogs to the drivers if they&amp;#39;re going to be your regular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why YSK: young hawks, eagles, or owls may become more desperate and go after barn kittens, chickens, or end up in your yard stranded&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each year raptors have babies. But each raptor, or breeding pair, prefer to have their own territory to hunt in. Especially as food becomes more scarce in the winter. Beginning now, and extending throughout the winter is what a lot of wildlife biologists refer to as “Raptor Season”. This is the final test basically for these babies, seeing if they can survive throughout the winter. They may be more desperate. Usually they won’t go after anything near humans (even chickens despite how many hawks have taken your chickens, only large ones can and even then they would prefer squirrel) however during this time they are more focused on not starving than safety. They may dive into cars, try to go after barn cats, try to go after chickens, or you may even find them in your yard. Raptors that become too weak to fly will quickly get parasites from prolonged time on the ground, keeping them grounded until they find help or die. Keep an extra eye out and extra caution for our winged friends as we progress more into winter!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tl;dr Raptor starvation during the winter can lead to increased exposure&lt;/p&gt;

This is EXACTLY WHAT YOU SHOULD NOT DO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The official guidance is unanimous. In the event of an earthquake, do one thing and one thing ONLY:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DUCK&lt;/strong&gt; beneath a nearby sturdy object. If no sturdy desk, table, or countertop is available, duck next to an interior wall away form windows, heavy frames, shelves, and fixtures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COVER&lt;/strong&gt; your neck and head with your arms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOLD&lt;/strong&gt; on to the object you&amp;#39;re covering under until the shaking stops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why YSK: In a major earthquake, it will be &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; difficult to move around inside a building. The ground is literally sweeping violently side to side beneath your feet. It would be like trying to run on the bed of a flatbed truck while it drives over a series of speed bumps. The danger of tripping and falling is serious, and winding up on the floor with your head and neck exposed while objects may be falling down all around you is a VERY DANGEROUS situation to be in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, even if you manage to get out of the building, you will have to pass through the area immediately beneath the facade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glass, masonry, concrete, etc...can very likely be separating from the facade of the building and falling to the street below, even if the building itself remains standing. You do NOT want to be in the area beneath the exterior of a building while the shaking is taking place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only AFTER the shaking stops should you check for injuries, put on sturdy shoes, and calmly leave the building until it can be inspected for structural damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The USGS web page on what to do during an earthquake reads:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are INDOORS -- STAY THERE! Get under a desk or table and hang on to it (Drop, Cover, and Hold on!) or move into a hallway or against an inside wall. STAY CLEAR of windows, fireplaces, and heavy furniture or appliances. GET OUT of the kitchen, which is a dangerous place (things can fall on you). DON&amp;#39;T run downstairs or rush outside while the building is shaking or while there is danger of falling and hurting yourself or being hit by falling glass or debris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The University of Washington advises:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DO NOT run outside or to other rooms during shaking: The area near the exterior walls of a building is the most dangerous place to be. Windows, facades and architectural details are often the first parts of the building to collapse. To stay away from this danger zone, stay inside if you are inside and outside if you are outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

You&amp;#39;ll just be spinning your wheels so to speak. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they say, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not sure, but I&amp;#39;m open to looking at whatever proof/evidence you have.&amp;quot; that&amp;#39;s a completely valid response. Some people don&amp;#39;t know what it would take to change their opinion, but if they&amp;#39;re open to the idea of seeing evidence that goes against their beliefs, then it could warrant dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020, 67% of covered workers in the U.S. were receiving coverage through a self-funded plan. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kff.org/report-section/ehbs-2020-section-10-plan-funding/&quot;&gt;(Linked source)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Self-funded&amp;quot; means that any health premiums collected only come from that employer AND are only used on healthcare expenses for that employer. In many cases, this also allows the employer to customize elements of what they will allow to be covered and not covered. Self-funded plans can also circumvent most state-level insurance mandates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your insurance doesn&amp;#39;t cover something like &amp;quot;transgender services&amp;quot;, that decision could be on your employer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#39;t like the payments for your mental/behavioral health provider?  That might be something that&amp;#39;s controllable by your employer - not the insurer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your buddy went in for XYZ procedure and his was fully paid for by ABC Insurance?  If you also have an ABC Insurance card, even if you had the same procedure done on the exact same day from the exact same provider, yours might NOT be paid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we all wonder why the U.S. Healthcare system needs an overhaul...&lt;/p&gt;
