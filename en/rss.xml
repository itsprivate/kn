He even made me feel guilty for asking for a salary increase saying that I was lucky to have the position and that there were plenty of other people out there that would love the opportunity I had. At the end of the day, if a company is growing and you are contributing to that growth, you should never feel guilty for knowing your worth and asking for a salary increase. If your manager can&amp;amp;#39;t see your worth, there will always be another company that will be able to.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: I recently changed jobs and got a 20% payrise - sent my boss an email after I left my previous job saying &amp;amp;quot;thanks for not believing in me and making me realise that others did&amp;amp;quot; lol&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

What many may not realize is the impact of that kind of behavior has long term effects on one&amp;amp;#39;s self esteem, view of relationships, mental health (negative core self beliefs, trauma, PTSD/CPTSD, anxiety, depression, etc etc) and needs as a person. Thats why its important to stop the cycle and learn to communicate properly. Healing is definitely possible.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It doesn&amp;amp;#39;t matter how well they treat you after or how sincerely they apologize. It doesn&amp;amp;#39;t matter if they are your parents or guardians. This is not normal healthy behavior. Healthy relationships involve talking about problems and working things out. There is no hurtful name-calling or blaming things on the other person. If they are willing to call you names to get a rise out of you on purpose, how do you think that will work out with children or years down the line?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Its hard enough to find a relationship, I get it, but yelling and screaming happen when there is not enough healthy communication. 9/10 times situations that involve yelling or screaming could be solved by a calm, emotionally mature, and honest conversation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you know you do this, own it. Talk to a therapist about why and work on it. You will be so much happier and healthier when you can communicate your feelings through talking rather than the less effective and more hurtful mode of verbal violence&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

It is in her own best interest to move you right on through to the dining room, so please be assured that if there was anything she can do to lower your wait time, she would do it. She does not deserved to be yelled at because your wait is 15 minutes longer than you expected. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Pretty much every restaurant is woefully understaffed right now. Those that survived the last couple of years are trying to operate as lean as possible. Until the restaurant industry has time to recover, this is likely to remain the case. Even then, I imagine they will have a tough time attracting enough workers to become fully staffed unless they make dramatic improvements to how their employees are compensated. The hostess that you are taking your frustrations out on is one of, if not the lowest paid, employees in the restaurant, and in many cases it is their very first job. With the staffing situation the way it is now, she is very likely having to bus tables, answer the phone, pack to-go orders, and do cleanliness checks on the restrooms, as well as manage the waitlist and coordinate the seating of diners. On top of that, she is going to be the first one to get grief from her managers when customers start to pile up waiting to be seated.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The hostess at a restaurant cannot seat you if there isn’t a table available for you. It’s as simple as that. Just because you see an empty table, or a dozen empty tables, doesn’t mean that there are enough servers on duty to work those tables. The hostess cannot put you at a table that doesn’t have a server assigned to it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you MUST yell at someone, first of all, get some psychiatric help at the first opportunity, but until then maybe yell at other diners who loiter for an hour after their meal is finished. Or yell at the manager, who at least to some degree has some control over how the restaurant is staffed at any given time. Maybe write a scathing email or make an irate phone call to the corporate office, if it’s a chain, or the owner if it’s privately owned, and insist that they raise wages or do whatever they need to do to attract more staff.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Please, if you are not capable of being patient and showing a little bit of grace, please just eat at home. You never know the battles someone else is fighting in their life, and your harsh words at that particular time may have an impact that on them that you never intended.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

A glance at the comments on a post will show you just how many people lap it up without question.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The reason you should know is that it’s this blind belief that advertisers and scammers exploit daily. We are living in an age where companies have learnt how easy it is to manipulate us. By taking everything you see at face value you are opening yourself up to this manipulation. And basically opening up your wallet, and in some cases your values and belief systems.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It’s quick and easy to do a quick internet search about anything to find out if something is likely to be true. Don’t be one of the people who comment how impressed you are at a particular post because this just adds to the claim and makes it more difficult for others to determine if something is genuine. It should be obvious not to believe everything you see online but it seems like we have started to take that for granted and have forgotten that lately.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;If you use a whitening laundry powder labeled &amp;amp;quot;Safe on colors&amp;amp;quot; AND wash using cold water&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, then most whites will stay white even when washing them with dark or colored clothes. I&amp;amp;#39;ve done this many times using Oxi-clean White Revive and it&amp;amp;#39;s always worked. I believe there&amp;amp;#39;s other brands with similar products.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Just be careful not to wash clothes with heavy ink (e.g. Tie-dye or sharpie) in the same load as whites.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;EDIT: To clarify, the whitening powder isn&amp;amp;#39;t strictly necessary unless you want to use a whitener. A lot of people do, but if you don&amp;amp;#39;t, then you can skip it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Although these people should just be ignored, it is still there and stopping people from getting food they need. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you&amp;amp;#39;ve ever worked a job, and paid taxes, you&amp;amp;#39;ve already contributed so don&amp;amp;#39;t feel bad. These benefits are a very GOOD thing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyways, with the help of technology it&amp;amp;#39;s easy to shop online with EBT or SNAP and get curbside delivery, or you can even have your groceries delivered directly to your house.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Just because you spent an hour and half on liver and onions doesn’t mean you made something tastier than a regular grilled cheese. Just because you wrote a song mixing time signatures and changing keys doesn’t mean it sounds better than some rudimentary Green Day tune. Just because you spent 8 years on a degree, doesn’t mean you developed a skill worth more than  $12/hr. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some valuable things in this world take hard work, but not everything that takes hard work is valuable. Before you work hard on something, ask if it’s the best use of your effort.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It also dismisses them and does not let them finish speaking about it. “At least” shuts them down. They should not have to defend why their problem is a problem to you.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Finally, just because they do not have it the worst or it could be worse, does not mean that they are not experiencing the pain from their own problem. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The example I’ve seen countless times is simple. If someone is telling you about a miscarriage and the emotional/physical pain they are experiencing and you reply, “at least you can have (or already have) children,” you are completely shutting them out.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Like any traumatic experience, rape has long and lasting impacts to the victim. And due to the unfortunate controversial nature of rape/ rape-culture in itself, stuff like the psychological repercussions of it are often not spoken about enough and swept under the rug.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“Rape trauma syndrome” (RTS) is the name attributed to the disruptions to normal, physical, emotional, and interpersonal behavior as a result of an assault. There are different stages assigned to the time after the assault. Symptoms can range from a complete minimization of the abuse (blaming oneself, watering it down), to dramatization (cannot stop speaking about it). Needless to say the emotional/physical effects of a rape range greatly. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sexual relationships of a rape survivor often become disturbed and they too, range greatly. Some victims shield from contact and develop a fear of intimacy, while others become hyper sexual or “promiscuous” as a subconscious means to reassert a measure of control over their sexual relationships. While this is a documented and common experience, it’s often overshadowed by the depiction of a sex-repulsed survivor. Sometimes due to the shame of it and purity culture in general.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Many people vastly underestimate the forces even small bodies of water can impart.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There&amp;amp;#39;s a silly little rule of thumb that&amp;amp;#39;s actually pretty helpful. If you dropped a flower in the water, would you have time to bend down and pick it up, or is flowing away out of reach by the time you did?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you can pick it up, you&amp;amp;#39;re fine.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If not, basically, if the water goes over your ankles you can be taken off your feet at any moment, mind the rocks, but are okayish.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If it goes over your knees, you&amp;amp;#39;re at serious risk of being taken by the stream.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you&amp;amp;#39;re trying to move something with a large surface area, like the wheels of a car, or god help you its deep enough to be pushing on the whole sides of the car, you&amp;amp;#39;re fucked.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Moving bodies of water contain incredible energies, water is really, really dense. I mean just think about picking up a big bucket of the stuff.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I see a lot of people drive cars over roads that have flooded and are in motion, and every time I wish I could scream at them before they go in.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Water is so dense, that whole ass car only weighs as much as 1-2 cubic meters of water. Its surface area can have a LOT more than that pushing on it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Your car absolutely will not win.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I actually kind of liked truffle oil, until I ate the real deal, which is so much more subtle, deep and pleasant in flavor. It’s also far more expensive, sure—Italian white truffles can be over $200 per oz. But cheaper varieties, like Burgundy black truffles, are about a tenth of that: an expense well worth it in my opinion.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What irks me most is that restaurants will have dishes on their menu described as having truffles—truffle risotto, truffle fries, etc, but are really using truffle oil instead of the real thing. Not only do they use this as an excuse to upcharge the dish by ten dollars because of the “luxury” status, they also overwhelm the food with a pungent chemical inferior to the advertised product.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But don’t take my word for it:
&amp;amp;quot;One of the most pungent, ridiculous ingredients ever known to chef,&amp;amp;quot; Gordon Ramsay once told a competitor on MasterChef.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Reaching for the oil is &amp;amp;quot;a sure sign of someone who doesn&amp;amp;#39;t know what they&amp;amp;#39;re doing,&amp;amp;quot; Joe Bastianich said in the same episode.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Fake truffle flavoring is one of those things that&amp;amp;#39;s especially upsetting, because not only does it taste like a bad chemical version of the real thing, it&amp;amp;#39;s the flavor that almost everyone now associates with truffles,&amp;amp;quot; Jonathan Gold says.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So, if you enjoy truffle oil, power to you. But be aware that it is not truffles that you are tasting and paying big money for. And if you ever get a chance, try some real truffles: they rule.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When that happens, the worker has almost no way of politely declining the conversation if they don&amp;amp;#39;t feel like talking. For one, it could be considered rude, and the worker probably has to take special care to not hurt customers&amp;amp;#39; feelings.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Second, the worker can&amp;amp;#39;t just say &amp;amp;quot;Hey, I&amp;amp;#39;ve got to go&amp;amp;quot; and walk away. They have to stay, sometimes at the exact spot where you&amp;amp;#39;re having the conversation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The only thing that they can really do is maybe say &amp;amp;quot;Hey, I&amp;amp;#39;ve got a lot of work to do, can we talk later?&amp;amp;quot;, but some people wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t want to lie if they &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;don&amp;amp;#39;t&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; actually have work to do, and it can be awkward even if it&amp;amp;#39;s true.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I work at a hotel and this happens all the time. It&amp;amp;#39;s basically in my job description to be engaged with guests at all times, during conversations both casual and otherwise, which makes them think that I like these talks way more than I actually do.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even when I try to give hints that I&amp;amp;#39;m not into it by not saying much, shifting my eye contact to my desk, or typing on my computer, they rarely get the hint. It&amp;amp;#39;s a terrible feeling to be all but forced to have a conversation when you really would rather not.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Please don&amp;amp;#39;t keep people in long conversations unless you&amp;amp;#39;re &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;sure&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; they&amp;amp;#39;re into it, especially if the other party is at their job.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

They do in fact have a lot of other tasks to do besides clean up after you, and although they are getting paid to keep the store tidy, their job description doesn’t include being your maid. A little mess is fine, but don’t be that person that all the employees will bitch about when you leave. Making all that mess is unnecessary and you’re making their life much harder when it is &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;SO&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; easy to not.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So if a worker asks if you need help with a size, let them get it. They’ll make no mess while getting it, you get the size you want, and then they have more time for the important tasks because they no longer have to clean up your mess. Everyone wins.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;EDIT FOR CONTEXT: Majority of this relates to clothing stores, but works for all goods stores. In general though if you’re making a mess looking for something and an employee comes and asks to help you, don’t say no because you can look for it, say yes because they can look for it without making a mess and it makes their life easier.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;EDIT AGAIN: Even if you live somewhere where being approached by staff to help is uncommon (which is crazy weird to me), the point is just don’t make a mess. Regardless of which country you’re in, the workers have better shit to do than clean up after people who somehow don’t know how to look through a neatly stacked pile of clothes without making it look like a bomb went off.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

This means your mail carrier and package delivery people including companies like Amazon even are working long hours and are on a strict timeline, and may even get extra work thrown on them if they complete their work quick enough and not really be given notice/time to prepare. Plus they can&amp;amp;#39;t exactly carry and bunch of food/drinks (especially in cities) to last all day. Doing small things like leaving a bottle of water in the mailbox (marked for them, otherwise they may not take it due to a fear of theft claims) or a cooler even clearly marked &amp;amp;quot;help yourself delivery people&amp;amp;quot; can make a huge difference in their day. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My mom worked mail delivery for years and she always would point out the houses with glee as we drive through our small town that she remembered would have a bottle of water or snack waiting for her even when she was just a sub, as in didn&amp;amp;#39;t even have a set route every workday. When she got a set route some customers would even go as far as leaving her home made cookies and gift cards for coffee or lunch occasionally.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TLDR; Appreciate the people who even though are just doing their job, still keep doing it even when it&amp;amp;#39;s not even what they signed up for. You may just be another house if you don&amp;amp;#39;t, but you will probably be a highlight of a strangers day if you do and in today&amp;amp;#39;s world we need more of that!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit; if you are someone delivering please say what country/area of the country/service and what would help you whatever time of the year and any rules you have to follow to accept anything. About to go to sleep, but when I wake up sometime tomorrow I will edit again and add a list as best I can for anyone trying to set up care packages! Obviously water and snacks, but based off a comment I realized I&amp;amp;#39;ve got a bunch of cheap shake to activate hand warmers that could really be nice for someone out all day. I also know some companies have policies where &amp;amp;quot;helping themselves&amp;amp;quot; could be reported in today&amp;amp;#39;s day and age so we could avoid it being a worry I&amp;amp;#39;d like to know how! :) Have a good night/day everyone!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

They have a good job/family/home/etc. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Depression can be brought on by major events that cause sadness, like grief or trauma. But it can also exist without any obvious external cause. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sadness is like a stubbed toe: it sucks and is temporary in most cases. Depression is like a broken bone: if not properly cared for, it can heal poorly and be debilitating for life. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you&amp;amp;#39;re depressed, stop blaming yourself for not having a &amp;amp;quot;reason&amp;amp;quot; and get the help you need to heal as best you can. If you find yourself thinking this about other people, try and step back to remember that depression is not a choice&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.healthline.com/health/depression/depression-vs-sadness&quot;&amp;gt;How to spot the difference &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m getting some push back on the &amp;amp;quot;chemical imbalance&amp;amp;quot; phrase so I did a quick fact check on myself. It&amp;amp;#39;s an outdated theory. Much research is needed but current thinking is there are many things that cause depression and not all of them are situational, which is my core point. For the scientific report, check the NIH link below or find peer reviewed journals and reliable sources for the most relevant information.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some of those can include:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Gum disease, which can increase your risk of developing heart disease.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;If you don&amp;amp;#39;t take care of your mouth, you risk developing a bacterial infection in your bloodstream. This, in turn, can potentially affect your heart (specifically heart valves -- be very careful if you&amp;amp;#39;ve had heart surgery to repair/replace them).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Poor dental care can lead to type 2 diabetes, and there&amp;amp;#39;s an apparent link between type 2 and cardiovascular disease.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s worth noting that more research is needed to determine exactly what the links are, why they occur and how prevalent they are. But studies seem to indicate that they do, at the very least, exist in some capacity, and you can never be too careful when it comes to your health (especially not with your heart).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Practice good dental hygiene by doing some or, ideally, all of the following:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Brushing your teeth twice a day for 2 minutes at a time (make sure you are brushing all the way to the back).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Flossing once a day.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Using mouthwash frequently.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;If possible, use toothpaste with or drink water that contains fluoride.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;See a dentist regularly for check-ups and cleanings.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Obviously, you can have heart issues regardless of the state of your teeth. And if you &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;do&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; have heart issues (of any kind, whether congenital or adult), it&amp;amp;#39;s still important to maintain good oral hygiene so that you don&amp;amp;#39;t potentially make those problems worse.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Regardless, it&amp;amp;#39;s still a good idea to brush your teeth twice a day. It keeps more than just your mouth happy!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When considering paying $0.27 per serving vs $0.14 per serving, you should know that there is very little difference (if any) between most brands and their off-brand, and often times the difference is that the &amp;amp;quot;off-brand&amp;amp;quot; retains the better tasting original recipe vs the name brand Cereals cost-cutting, recipe changing, etc;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Name Brand cereal seems better due to their superior marketing, however in almost every instance (depending on the off-brand) the non-name brand cereal beats the name brand cereal in blind taste tests.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This means that their marketing is working, however they are in reality NOT better, in almost every instance.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Note:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; I &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;know&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; there are some cereal off-brands out there which clearly do not match/beat the name brand, however for the most part, the majority of them are identical or better than the original.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And... &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;With Kellogg firing 1400 workers rather than providing better wages or working environment&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, it&amp;amp;#39;s important to remember that, for the most part, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;your extra $ is going toward their superior marketing and trickery to make their brand seem &amp;amp;quot;better&amp;amp;quot;, not a truly better product.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Spend your money in places that share your values, and in this case, on an often identical or superior product. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Paying more $, in this case does not equal a better product, and in fact only gets you a more commonly marketed name, and often a more poorly performing brand in taste tests.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Edit:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; For those looking for taste tests, there are simply too many to link here, depending on which &amp;amp;quot;off brand&amp;amp;quot; you want to see tested vs the big name cereals. Google &amp;amp;quot;off brand cereal taste test&amp;amp;quot; and you&amp;amp;#39;ll find many in-depth reviews and even videos describing the look, and the taste difference (if any) of whatever brand they&amp;amp;#39;re testing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
