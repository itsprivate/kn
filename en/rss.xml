Too much focus is put on the workout itself without addressing the real problem of why so many start and then quit. Everyone struggles, but some have sourced the key, the right mental gymnastics to continue the regimen despite regular life pressures getting in the way.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After a lifetime of joking the #1 cause of injury is exercise, I found myself at a crossroads when I had to run about 30 meters (100 feet). I was a mess, barely able to breathe. I loosened my shirt and my pants. I knew i wasn’t in good shape but I hadn’t considered I was in terrible shape.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I started walking around the block, then longer, then jogging small parts, then jogging most of it, then moved on to hiking. I learned my body prefers Interval training, so I focused on this whether it was around the neighbourhood or into the woods.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After 3 months I was noticeably more fit but I was still struggling mentally with just getting out the door. I always had SO MANY reasons to not exercise today, mostly related to urgency of other matters. Put simply, I would find important distractions and then convince myself it was “too late” to do it today and to try again tomorrow.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It took about 6 months of mental retraining to stop this bad habit while also convincing myself I enjoyed it. Some tricks I used:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1 - Whatever other urgent thing you have to do, don&amp;amp;#39;t argue with yourself on the priority  If you have a nagging mind like I do, I found it easier to just agree with the thought to skip today and then just do the exercise anyways.  Its like the old adage of not what you say, but what you do.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2 - Any opportunity I had to talk about my training, I did so and said how much I loved it. Even though I was lying, I said I loved it and I said it to myself regularly as well. Weirdly, after awhile you start to actually love it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;3 - Meditation, It helped a lot learning how to “let thoughts go”, even important valid thoughts. Just because something is important, it doesn’t mean it’s more important than your health. Let the valid and important thought go along with any other thoughts and do your exercises&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;4 - Find anyone to do it with. Your friends keep you honest. Or get a dog. That sad look they give you, or excited when they hear keys, it really works. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;5 - Upper body and general muscle development are key not just for balance, but muscles burn more calories. You may not be as toned as the person putting in a couple hours a day, but any increase in muscle makes a better working body that burns more calories for the same amount of work. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;6 - Even if its just 5 minutes. This is my go to when nothing else is working. It&amp;amp;#39;s amazing how taking 5 minutes can turn into 15 and then into 30. And you feel like a boss afterwards.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;7 - Keep mixing it up. I go one day at the gym, then a neighborhood walk, then Beat Sabre, then a good hike, and then just drive somewhere new. I found I failed when it&amp;amp;#39;s just the same thing over and over, every week, forever. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It’s been 4 years now and I do love it and look forward to it each week. BUT!... I still mentally struggle with it. Or I should say the desire to skip it is always on the perimeter trying to get back in, and when it does, I just take my toolkit out and use one of my tricks to get back into it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Make this the year you make it stick. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

While professional help is probably always the best option (if you can afford it), technology can surely play a role in terms of education and prevention.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Games for Emotional and Mental Health lab is a group of behaviour change researchers and game designers, pioneering a model that combines evidence-based wellbeing tools with play and storytelling, because they’ve found that most existing apps fail to engage people long enough to deliver any benefits.   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The lab recently opened a &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://utwentebs.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9uwhwDopngYIocu&quot;&amp;gt;study&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; that you can take part in, focusing on a new iOS game that teaches self-awareness through a choose-your-own-adventure story.

It&amp;amp;#39;s odourless and colourless, so it&amp;amp;#39;s very hard to detect.   For this reason, it&amp;amp;#39;s always a good idea to ensure your fire detector/smoke alarm also has CO detection  (most of the newer fire detectors come standard with this nowadays).      &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m making this post because I noticed a lot of black soot (black powdery substance) building up on the bottom of my girlfriend&amp;amp;#39;s pots and pans when we cook at her condo.  I also have a gas range stove at my place but have never seen build-up of soot on my cooking equipment.  This soot will come off as black dust on your finger if you rub the bottom of a pan after it cools.  Recently, the CO alarm went off on the smoke detector at my girlfriend&amp;amp;#39;s place, which obviously caused some concern and I started to look into the potential causes while she called the fire department.  Be sure to get out of the house and/or ventilated it by opening the windows.  Getting out of the home right away is the safest option and highly recommended. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One of the best articles I found was this one:   &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.abe.iastate.edu/extension-and-outreach/carbon-monoxide-poisoning-checking-for-complete-combustion-aen-175/&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.abe.iastate.edu/extension-and-outreach/carbon-monoxide-poisoning-checking-for-complete-combustion-aen-175/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The article shows that soot can be a sign that your natural gas stove is has an incorrect mixture of air and gas, which can lead to an incomplete burn.  This incomplete burn can cause the build-up of soot and carbon monoxide in your home.   While this typically creates CO in amounts that are not deadly, they can cause a lot of health problems over time and if the ventilation in your home is poor, it can potentially be fatal. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some symptoms of CO poisoning are headaches, shortness of breath, dizziness, weaknesss, confusion, and nausea.  If you have any of these symptoms that seem to clear up when you leave home, check the bottom of your pots and pans for clues.    The article above goes into a lot better detail than I ever could, and I&amp;amp;#39;m definitely no expert in this field.   I figured this could be life-saving information and was worth a share.     If anyone who&amp;amp;#39;s an expert in this that has corrections for my info and/or more information on this, I encourage you to share it in the thread. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Stay safe out there,&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The smallest amount of antifreeze can kill cats, and kill them horribly. Signs can show within 30 minutes of ingestion; they begin to stumble like they are drunk, start to find breathing difficult. They vomit, they can have seizures. Finally, their kidneys give out. It is absolutely horrific for pet and owner.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I know this from experience, having lost &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/gallery/4ZzwTLh&quot;&amp;gt;two cats&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; to antifreeze poisoning in the space of one week.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;*The worst thing about antifreeze is it&amp;amp;#39;s active ingredient, Ethylene Glycol, has an appealing, sweet taste. Once found, your pet will continue you eat it. Not knowing they are killing themselves.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s also vital to know &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rspca.org.uk/adviceandwelfare/pets/cats/health/poisoning/antifreeze&quot;&amp;gt;the symptoms&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; of antifreeze poisoning, as depending on dosage it only takes 2-3 days for your kitty&amp;amp;#39;s kidneys to fail, and the cat to pass.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Please please please, save a cat this Christmas. Store, dispose of and use any antifreeze safely, or buy pet-safe antifreeze (that doesn&amp;amp;#39;t contain ethylene glycol).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Thoracic or chest breathing is better for physical exertion and may actually make you more tense. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/in-depth/decrease-stress-by-using-your-breath/art-20267197&quot;&amp;gt;(Source: Mayo Clinic)&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; Knowing how to use diaphragmatic breathing can help you calm down in stressful situations and potentially avoid a panic attack. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;From the link above, for those who don’t want to read the whole thing: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;•Get into a comfortable position. Close your eyes and bring your attention to your body and breath.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;•Inhale deeply through your nose, allowing your abdomen to fill with air, gently expanding out. Exhale by relaxing and releasing all of the air through your nose.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;•Place one hand on your abdomen, right below your navel, and the other hand on your upper chest. Take a deep breath in through your nose and out through your nose. Feel the coolness of the air as it enters in and the warmth as it flows out.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;•As you breathe in and out through your nose, focus on shifting your breath so that you can feel the rise and fall of your breathing in your abdomen more than in your chest. In other words, make the hand that rests on your abdomen move more than the hand on your chest. Take a deep breath in through your nose, sending it through the back of your throat and down to your belly. Let your abdomen slowly deflate as you exhale through your nose.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;•Take three more slow, deep breaths with conscious focus on the rise and fall of your abdomen. Continue to breathe fully and deeply, allowing and trusting the body as the breath slows and becomes more relaxed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit 1: Thank you to &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/u/inspirationisagift&quot;&amp;gt;u/inspirationisagift&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; for adding this info in a comment, because it’s actually really useful!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Using a breathing method like box breathing/square breathing has been empirically supported as an alternative method that helps with panic attacks and times of high stress/anxiety as it brings the oxygen level down. This method deactivates the &amp;amp;#39;fight flight freeze&amp;amp;#39; stress response which relies on increased levels of oxygen.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Deep breathing can sometimes give the body that extra oxygen which keeps the body in a stressed state, wheras by reducing respiration/oxygen intake, it helps to activate the &amp;amp;#39;rest and digest&amp;amp;#39; system instead. Just in case anyone has found deep breathing to not be helpful 🙂&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

It is important to not overwater your houseplants as they can grow mold, mildew, or be susceptible to fungus and other diseases with excessive water. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A good rule of thumb is to touch the soil with your finger to see if the substrate is moist, and avoid watering again until it is dry. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also, leaf tips can go brown from cold. Do not cut these off until warmer weather arrives, as this is one of the plant’s protection against frost. They essentially write off a part of themselves to take the damage from the cold in order to protect the rest of them. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Good luck, and happy gardening!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

It uses roughly the same melody as &amp;amp;quot;Happy Birthday&amp;amp;quot; for the same eight bars, but with much better lyrics. The original lyrics are as follows:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;What day is today?&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s Nibbler&amp;amp;#39;s birthday!&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;What a day for a birthday!&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Let&amp;amp;#39;s all have some cake!&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These lyrics were written for TV in order to avoid infringing the copyright for &amp;amp;quot;Happy Birthday&amp;amp;quot;, but they are good enough to replace &amp;amp;quot;Happy Birthday&amp;amp;quot; entirely if adopted by the public.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Why YSK: Saying the phrase &amp;amp;quot;Happy birthday to you&amp;amp;quot; four times in a row is boring and embarassing for everyone involved, and is often thought of as the least fun part of a birthday party. These lyrics are more fun and creative, and they touch on the most exciting themes for a child: special occasions, attention, and cake.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Either way, you don&amp;amp;#39;t necessarily need to know what every light means as long as you pay attention to the color.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Green: Non issue, just a notification. Things like fog lights, or ready to move on hybrids.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Amber: Non urgent issue. These are for issues that are OK to continue driving with, but should be fixed soon. Things like check engine, ABS failure, traction control failure, tire pressure, etc.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Red: Urgent issue. These are for issues that pose an immediate serious danger to you or the car. If a red light comes on, stop immediately. Things like no oil pressure, overheating, or brake failure, or charging system failure.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Charging system failure may sound like that should be an amber light, but there&amp;amp;#39;s a good reason it&amp;amp;#39;s red. It&amp;amp;#39;s rare for an alternator to just die all of a sudden, so that could also indicate a broken serpentine belt, which would also stop your water pump and power steering pump. It could also indicate an electrical fault that could, in serious cases, start a fire. Even if it&amp;amp;#39;s neither of those, when your battery dies, you are stranded. So that&amp;amp;#39;s why it&amp;amp;#39;s red.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Why YSK:  If you don&amp;amp;#39;t know what all the lights in your car mean, just knowing what the color means can save you a lot of money and avoid dangerous situations.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Police stations are just about the safest place you can meet publicly, and also act as a filter against people with bad intentions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m currently selling a high-priced item as a private party, and told a prospective buyer who wanted to see the item that he should meet me at my local police station.  He refused, and suggested a McDonald&amp;#39;s parking lot in a sketchy neighborhood instead.  His refusal to meet at the police station sounded my alarm bells, especially when he couldn&amp;#39;t articulate his objections to meeting there.  I called off the deal with him, and instead went with the next prospective buyer who not only had no objections to meeting at the police station, but expressed his appreciation for doing so at such a safe place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S.  Many police stations not only support this activity, but some will also provide a police officer to be present during the transaction upon request.&lt;/p&gt;

So if you receive a call from an unknown phone number which sounds like it &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be a recorded advertisement, then turn the tables on them by intentionally providing an unconventional response. Even if the computer on the other end doesn&amp;#39;t bail, it&amp;#39;ll still reveal itself as such pretty quickly, giving you the opportunity to disconnect from an obvious unsolicited phone advertisement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example: I just received a call which started out with, &amp;quot;Hello! My name is Andrew -- how are you?&amp;quot; No identifying company, no identifying purpose... just those words and nothing else. Of course, that&amp;#39;s not the way a legit phone solicitor starts a conversation, so I already suspected that it was a recording. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, I responded by directly asking, &amp;quot;Is this a recording?&amp;quot; My confirmation came in the form of a very brief clip of the first word that the recording was going to say next, which was abruptly interrupted by a line disconnection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So either I confused it enough to force a bail-out, or (more likely in my mind) my question was flagged as the type of thing that &amp;quot;non-spenders&amp;quot; tend to say, triggering the bail-out. Either way, I didn&amp;#39;t have to waste my time listening to the rest of their ad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You may be considering purchasing down-insulated products during the holiday season&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You may not know that the geese and duck feathers may be plucked while they are still alive, often several times over the course of their life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even if you aren&amp;#39;t vegan, you may not want to support this painful and inhumane practice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A single down coat can require feathers from 10-20 geese or ducks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are alternatives or more ethical sources of down you can consider purchasing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alternatives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many companies offer alternatives (and many have even banned using down altogether) There are several ways to search for down-alternative products. Usually they will have keywords such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Synthetic Insulation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Down-Alternative&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Featherless&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recycled Insulation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cotton or Rayon Filled&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ethically-Sourced Down Options&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are currently 2 certification standards for ethical down retrieval that work to combat this issue, RDS and GTDS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RDS -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://certifications.controlunion.com/en/certification-programs/certification-programs/rds-responsible-down-standard&quot;&gt;Responsible Down Standard&lt;/a&gt; is utilized by most ethically-aware companies, however even this standard has many flaws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Farm inspections are announced in advance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RDS allows for parallel farm operation (RDS and non-RDS down produced on the same farm)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RDS does not consider the parent farm (where the geese are hatched and raised)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GTDS -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://d2evkimvhatqav.cloudfront.net/documents/su_traceble_down_infopaper.pdf&quot;&gt;Global Traceable Down Standard&lt;/a&gt; is only utilized by Patagonia in partnership with the NSF, and is a much stricter certification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Years is around the corner and that means that many people start going to the gym again or start at the gym for the first time. If you fall into this category (or currently have an overpriced gym membership) check with your health insurance provider to see if they offer any gym membership deals BEFORE signing up for any gym. Insurance companies know that they will likely save money long term having customers who are in better shape and thus often have deals on gym memberships. Personally, my insurance offers a program that costs me $25/m and in return I receive a nationwide membership to Planet Fitness, anytime fitness, LA fitness, Snap, Crunch, and a ton of other small and local gyms, or I may choose one single gym for free. Personally, I chose the $25/m program and in total, I get access to over 11k fitness facilities nationwide, which is great for when I travel or go on vacation and still wish to get to the gym. It would cost me hundreds of dollars a month to have the same access. My insurance is certainly not the only one. Some companies may not offer as good as options but are normally still cheaper than going through the gym directly. I know not everyone has health insurance and that’s not a discussion I wish to get into, but for those who do and wish to get a gym membership, definitely check with your provider first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why YSK: it is almost always cheaper to go through your insurance company (if they offer memberships) for your gym membership than to go through the gym directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not picking on the US, it&amp;#39;s just the majority of people on Reddit are from there. I&amp;#39;m from the UK and our reading age is lower at 9 years, so it&amp;#39;s not a dunk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a good link which is talking about my point:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://centerforplainlanguage.org/what-is-readability/#:%7E:text=The%20average%20American%20is%20considered,readability%20level%20of%20age%20nine&quot;&gt;https://centerforplainlanguage.org/what-is-readability/#:~:text=The%20average%20American%20is%20considered,readability%20level%20of%20age%20nine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly some people try to link reading age to intelligence which just isn&amp;#39;t the case. People with a low reading age can be very intelligent. There are many difficulties that people struggle with that can impair their reading age, but doesn&amp;#39;t affect how intelligent they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why YSK: If you want to get your message across to the widest number of people you &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to use simple language, you can&amp;#39;t assume everyone has the same vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being overtly and overly sesquipedalian can make you seem churlish, and alienate your audience. 😜&lt;/p&gt;

A fluid ounce is 28.41ml in British Imperial but 29.57ml in US Customary units. An imperial pint is 20 fl. oz. compared to 16 fl. oz. in the US and an imperial gallon is 160 fl. oz. compared to 128 fl. oz. in the US. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why YSK: there are plenty of places where this is relevant, such as fuel prices and value for money, but in a word, baking. When following online recipes it is easy to mistake one for the other, for example for people in the UK who use both imperial and metric at different times, or for people in Canada where there&amp;#39;s a lot of US imports, and this can lead to irredeemable mistakes with some of the more unforgiving recipes. If you&amp;#39;re following an online recipe try to make sure you know which type of pints/fluid ounces is being used. A dead giveaway for US Customary units is Cups, as Cups are not used in the imperial system.&lt;/p&gt;

I can&amp;#39;t guarantee that it will work, but it did for me.

I contacted Comcast and they informed me that I was likely seeing only that option because of my &amp;quot;current plan&amp;quot; and that I&amp;#39;d need to call a certain number to downgrade. Of course that number had a highly trained sales rep who fed me a bunch of crappy bundle offers that didn&amp;#39;t fill my needs at all until I just told her to downgrade to Gigabit internet only.&lt;/p&gt;

I have dozens of patients each week who come in with symptoms and complaints that are likely a viral illness. I explain in detail viral illnesses to family but in the end, it seems most want antibiotics. I even have patients who will then go to urgent care the next day, usually not seeing a Pediatrician, and will then get ABX or steroids as those places pass it out like candy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can easily give antibiotics. In fact, if I give ABX, I can justify billing at a higher level to insurance (99214 vs a 99213). I not only make more money, but parents leave happier. Is it the right thing to do? Not at all. When I don&amp;#39;t give ABX to a family, not only do I risk parents not being happy and leaving me a poor review, but I then likely will have to dedicate time for phone call follow ups as these families tend to call for ongoing symptoms (need to let the viral illness run its course). I understand it&amp;#39;s tough to take a day off from work and take your kid to the doctor just to be told to continue supportive care, but its the right thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So please parents, when I don&amp;#39;t prescribe ABX, I do it truly because I care about your child. I have seen children have horrible Clostridium Difficile infections from ABX. I have seen a young girl with UTIs that are now resistant to almost every oral ABX, and she now requires to be routinely admitted for IV ABX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why YSK:&lt;/strong&gt; Passing out ABX like candy is the easy way out. I don&amp;#39;t do it cause I truly care about the wellbeing of your child.  Ongoing ABX use can potentially have devasting side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
