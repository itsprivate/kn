&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Time magazine isn&amp;amp;#39;t always praising the person they select. It is who they think &amp;amp;quot;for better &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;or for worse&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;... has done the most to influence the events of the year&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It also dismisses them and does not let them finish speaking about it. “At least” shuts them down. They should not have to defend why their problem is a problem to you.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Finally, just because they do not have it the worst or it could be worse, does not mean that they are not experiencing the pain from their own problem. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The example I’ve seen countless times is simple. If someone is telling you about a miscarriage and the emotional/physical pain they are experiencing and you reply, “at least you can have (or already have) children,” you are completely shutting them out.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Like any traumatic experience, rape has long and lasting impacts to the victim. And due to the unfortunate controversial nature of rape/ rape-culture in itself, stuff like the psychological repercussions of it are often not spoken about enough and swept under the rug.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“Rape trauma syndrome” (RTS) is the name attributed to the disruptions to normal, physical, emotional, and interpersonal behavior as a result of an assault. There are different stages assigned to the time after the assault. Symptoms can range from a complete minimization of the abuse (blaming oneself, watering it down), to dramatization (cannot stop speaking about it). Needless to say the emotional/physical effects of a rape range greatly. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sexual relationships of a rape survivor often become disturbed and they too, range greatly. Some victims shield from contact and develop a fear of intimacy, while others become hyper sexual or “promiscuous” as a subconscious means to reassert a measure of control over their sexual relationships. While this is a documented and common experience, it’s often overshadowed by the depiction of a sex-repulsed survivor. Sometimes due to the shame of it and purity culture in general.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Many people vastly underestimate the forces even small bodies of water can impart.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There&amp;amp;#39;s a silly little rule of thumb that&amp;amp;#39;s actually pretty helpful. If you dropped a flower in the water, would you have time to bend down and pick it up, or is flowing away out of reach by the time you did?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you can pick it up, you&amp;amp;#39;re fine.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If not, basically, if the water goes over your ankles you can be taken off your feet at any moment, mind the rocks, but are okayish.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If it goes over your knees, you&amp;amp;#39;re at serious risk of being taken by the stream.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you&amp;amp;#39;re trying to move something with a large surface area, like the wheels of a car, or god help you its deep enough to be pushing on the whole sides of the car, you&amp;amp;#39;re fucked.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Moving bodies of water contain incredible energies, water is really, really dense. I mean just think about picking up a big bucket of the stuff.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I see a lot of people drive cars over roads that have flooded and are in motion, and every time I wish I could scream at them before they go in.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Water is so dense, that whole ass car only weighs as much as 1-2 cubic meters of water. Its surface area can have a LOT more than that pushing on it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Your car absolutely will not win.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I actually kind of liked truffle oil, until I ate the real deal, which is so much more subtle, deep and pleasant in flavor. It’s also far more expensive, sure—Italian white truffles can be over $200 per oz. But cheaper varieties, like Burgundy black truffles, are about a tenth of that: an expense well worth it in my opinion.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What irks me most is that restaurants will have dishes on their menu described as having truffles—truffle risotto, truffle fries, etc, but are really using truffle oil instead of the real thing. Not only do they use this as an excuse to upcharge the dish by ten dollars because of the “luxury” status, they also overwhelm the food with a pungent chemical inferior to the advertised product.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But don’t take my word for it:
&amp;amp;quot;One of the most pungent, ridiculous ingredients ever known to chef,&amp;amp;quot; Gordon Ramsay once told a competitor on MasterChef.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Reaching for the oil is &amp;amp;quot;a sure sign of someone who doesn&amp;amp;#39;t know what they&amp;amp;#39;re doing,&amp;amp;quot; Joe Bastianich said in the same episode.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Fake truffle flavoring is one of those things that&amp;amp;#39;s especially upsetting, because not only does it taste like a bad chemical version of the real thing, it&amp;amp;#39;s the flavor that almost everyone now associates with truffles,&amp;amp;quot; Jonathan Gold says.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So, if you enjoy truffle oil, power to you. But be aware that it is not truffles that you are tasting and paying big money for. And if you ever get a chance, try some real truffles: they rule.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When that happens, the worker has almost no way of politely declining the conversation if they don&amp;amp;#39;t feel like talking. For one, it could be considered rude, and the worker probably has to take special care to not hurt customers&amp;amp;#39; feelings.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Second, the worker can&amp;amp;#39;t just say &amp;amp;quot;Hey, I&amp;amp;#39;ve got to go&amp;amp;quot; and walk away. They have to stay, sometimes at the exact spot where you&amp;amp;#39;re having the conversation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The only thing that they can really do is maybe say &amp;amp;quot;Hey, I&amp;amp;#39;ve got a lot of work to do, can we talk later?&amp;amp;quot;, but some people wouldn&amp;amp;#39;t want to lie if they &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;don&amp;amp;#39;t&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; actually have work to do, and it can be awkward even if it&amp;amp;#39;s true.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I work at a hotel and this happens all the time. It&amp;amp;#39;s basically in my job description to be engaged with guests at all times, during conversations both casual and otherwise, which makes them think that I like these talks way more than I actually do.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even when I try to give hints that I&amp;amp;#39;m not into it by not saying much, shifting my eye contact to my desk, or typing on my computer, they rarely get the hint. It&amp;amp;#39;s a terrible feeling to be all but forced to have a conversation when you really would rather not.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Please don&amp;amp;#39;t keep people in long conversations unless you&amp;amp;#39;re &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;sure&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; they&amp;amp;#39;re into it, especially if the other party is at their job.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

They do in fact have a lot of other tasks to do besides clean up after you, and although they are getting paid to keep the store tidy, their job description doesn’t include being your maid. A little mess is fine, but don’t be that person that all the employees will bitch about when you leave. Making all that mess is unnecessary and you’re making their life much harder when it is &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;SO&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; easy to not.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So if a worker asks if you need help with a size, let them get it. They’ll make no mess while getting it, you get the size you want, and then they have more time for the important tasks because they no longer have to clean up your mess. Everyone wins.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;EDIT FOR CONTEXT: Majority of this relates to clothing stores, but works for all goods stores. In general though if you’re making a mess looking for something and an employee comes and asks to help you, don’t say no because you can look for it, say yes because they can look for it without making a mess and it makes their life easier.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;EDIT AGAIN: Even if you live somewhere where being approached by staff to help is uncommon (which is crazy weird to me), the point is just don’t make a mess. Regardless of which country you’re in, the workers have better shit to do than clean up after people who somehow don’t know how to look through a neatly stacked pile of clothes without making it look like a bomb went off.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

This means your mail carrier and package delivery people including companies like Amazon even are working long hours and are on a strict timeline, and may even get extra work thrown on them if they complete their work quick enough and not really be given notice/time to prepare. Plus they can&amp;amp;#39;t exactly carry and bunch of food/drinks (especially in cities) to last all day. Doing small things like leaving a bottle of water in the mailbox (marked for them, otherwise they may not take it due to a fear of theft claims) or a cooler even clearly marked &amp;amp;quot;help yourself delivery people&amp;amp;quot; can make a huge difference in their day. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My mom worked mail delivery for years and she always would point out the houses with glee as we drive through our small town that she remembered would have a bottle of water or snack waiting for her even when she was just a sub, as in didn&amp;amp;#39;t even have a set route every workday. When she got a set route some customers would even go as far as leaving her home made cookies and gift cards for coffee or lunch occasionally.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TLDR; Appreciate the people who even though are just doing their job, still keep doing it even when it&amp;amp;#39;s not even what they signed up for. You may just be another house if you don&amp;amp;#39;t, but you will probably be a highlight of a strangers day if you do and in today&amp;amp;#39;s world we need more of that!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit; if you are someone delivering please say what country/area of the country/service and what would help you whatever time of the year and any rules you have to follow to accept anything. About to go to sleep, but when I wake up sometime tomorrow I will edit again and add a list as best I can for anyone trying to set up care packages! Obviously water and snacks, but based off a comment I realized I&amp;amp;#39;ve got a bunch of cheap shake to activate hand warmers that could really be nice for someone out all day. I also know some companies have policies where &amp;amp;quot;helping themselves&amp;amp;quot; could be reported in today&amp;amp;#39;s day and age so we could avoid it being a worry I&amp;amp;#39;d like to know how! :) Have a good night/day everyone!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

They have a good job/family/home/etc. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Depression can be brought on by major events that cause sadness, like grief or trauma. But it can also exist without any obvious external cause. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sadness is like a stubbed toe: it sucks and is temporary in most cases. Depression is like a broken bone: if not properly cared for, it can heal poorly and be debilitating for life. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you&amp;amp;#39;re depressed, stop blaming yourself for not having a &amp;amp;quot;reason&amp;amp;quot; and get the help you need to heal as best you can. If you find yourself thinking this about other people, try and step back to remember that depression is not a choice&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m getting some push back on the &amp;amp;quot;chemical imbalance&amp;amp;quot; phrase so I did a quick fact check on myself. It&amp;amp;#39;s an outdated theory. Much research is needed but current thinking is there are many things that cause depression and not all of them are situational, which is my core point. For the scientific report, check the NIH link below or find peer reviewed journals and reliable sources for the most relevant information.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some of those can include:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Gum disease, which can increase your risk of developing heart disease.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;If you don&amp;amp;#39;t take care of your mouth, you risk developing a bacterial infection in your bloodstream. This, in turn, can potentially affect your heart (specifically heart valves -- be very careful if you&amp;amp;#39;ve had heart surgery to repair/replace them).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Poor dental care can lead to type 2 diabetes, and there&amp;amp;#39;s an apparent link between type 2 and cardiovascular disease.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s worth noting that more research is needed to determine exactly what the links are, why they occur and how prevalent they are. But studies seem to indicate that they do, at the very least, exist in some capacity, and you can never be too careful when it comes to your health (especially not with your heart).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Practice good dental hygiene by doing some or, ideally, all of the following:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Brushing your teeth twice a day for 2 minutes at a time (make sure you are brushing all the way to the back).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Flossing once a day.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Using mouthwash frequently.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;If possible, use toothpaste with or drink water that contains fluoride.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;See a dentist regularly for check-ups and cleanings.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Obviously, you can have heart issues regardless of the state of your teeth. And if you &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;do&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; have heart issues (of any kind, whether congenital or adult), it&amp;amp;#39;s still important to maintain good oral hygiene so that you don&amp;amp;#39;t potentially make those problems worse.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Regardless, it&amp;amp;#39;s still a good idea to brush your teeth twice a day. It keeps more than just your mouth happy!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When considering paying $0.27 per serving vs $0.14 per serving, you should know that there is very little difference (if any) between most brands and their off-brand, and often times the difference is that the &amp;amp;quot;off-brand&amp;amp;quot; retains the better tasting original recipe vs the name brand Cereals cost-cutting, recipe changing, etc;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Name Brand cereal seems better due to their superior marketing, however in almost every instance (depending on the off-brand) the non-name brand cereal beats the name brand cereal in blind taste tests.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This means that their marketing is working, however they are in reality NOT better, in almost every instance.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Note:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; I &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;know&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; there are some cereal off-brands out there which clearly do not match/beat the name brand, however for the most part, the majority of them are identical or better than the original.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And... &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;With Kellogg firing 1400 workers rather than providing better wages or working environment&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, it&amp;amp;#39;s important to remember that, for the most part, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;your extra $ is going toward their superior marketing and trickery to make their brand seem &amp;amp;quot;better&amp;amp;quot;, not a truly better product.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Spend your money in places that share your values, and in this case, on an often identical or superior product. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Paying more $, in this case does not equal a better product, and in fact only gets you a more commonly marketed name, and often a more poorly performing brand in taste tests.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Edit:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; For those looking for taste tests, there are simply too many to link here, depending on which &amp;amp;quot;off brand&amp;amp;quot; you want to see tested vs the big name cereals. Google &amp;amp;quot;off brand cereal taste test&amp;amp;quot; and you&amp;amp;#39;ll find many in-depth reviews and even videos describing the look, and the taste difference (if any) of whatever brand they&amp;amp;#39;re testing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Applying at night, to clean DRY armpits is key. Even if you start getting sweaty before sleep, once you sleep you usually will sweat less which will allow enough time for the active ingredient to absorb.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This was inspired by the EMSKR and how to apply anti perspirant was way too low on list.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: I should probably mention that antiperspirant shouldn’t be used to prevent normal sweating. It’s a natural part of the body that helps you keep cool. If you are however excessively sweaty, first consider seeing your doctor or dermatologist. If you choose to include an anti perspirant in your routine, it’s most effective when used at  night. You also probably don’t need to use it as often as you think. Usually only every other night or a couple nights a week. Continue to apply normal deodorant in mornings as usual.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Tension headaches are the most common type of headache though most people unknowingly refer to them and treat them as migraines. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Migraines are a neurological problem and tension headaches are more of a muscular problem. Of course it is much more complicated than this but I’m trying to keep it as basic as possible.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I’ve suffered from tension headaches for the past 7 years that have been so bad they cost me friendships, relationships, and multiple jobs. Because of this I am very educated on tension headaches (but not so much migraines).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here’s how you can tell if you have tension headaches (and not migraines):&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Next time you have a headache take a muscle relaxer than contains ibuprofen (this is usually the purple coloured bottle). Robax platinum or any store brand version will work.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you find relief from the muscle relaxer, you likely have tension headaches, not migraines.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There are many other ways to test it such as using ice and heat as those tend to do good for tension headaches but they can also help some people with migraines, so it’s not a definite answer. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If the muscle relaxer does not relieve your pain you either have migraines or another type of headaches such as cluster headaches. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here are somethings to consider if you have tensions headaches as these are common factors in those that do. Consider fixing them as they can be the cause of your pain:
- do you grind your teeth? 
- are you low on magnesium?
- do you sleep on your side or stomach?
- do you have poor posture? 
- do you have proper tongue posture/where does your tongue sit in your mouth (it’s should be firmly pressed against the roof of your mouth). &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;not&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; relaxed. I used  to grind my teeth at night and would try to relax my whole mouth during the day to stop it. In reality this was causing more damage as one of the most important parts of good posture is having your tongue pressing against the roof of your mouth as frequently as possible) &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I have so much more advice but I don’t want to make this post too long. I hope I can help at least one person with this info :)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;1.)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Insurance will ALWAYS try to offer low first, sometimes leaving you with a balance owed on your old vehicle loan or leaving you unable to replace your vehicle with a vehicle of similar value.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2.)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; They may also try to force you to repair a vehicle which is so damaged that it will be nearly worthless &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;(or dangerous)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; after the repair.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With the price of used (and new) vehicles skyrocketing, insurance companies are pushing heavily to &amp;amp;quot;repair&amp;amp;quot; vehicles with fire damage, frame damage, firewall damage, etc; due to the high cost of replacing your vehicle often leaving you with something unsafe and also worthless to any potential buyer in the future.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;What to do:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Situation 1.)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Ask the insurance company to provide you with a list of 3 of the exact same trim of vehicle, in the same condition, with the same mileage for the $ they&amp;amp;#39;re giving you. They will be forced to give you a proper amount, in order to replace the vehicle you were paying them to insure.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Situation 2.)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Get an &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;independent estimate&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; from a reputable body shop, and if you believe your vehicle is beyond repair and ask the body shop if it were their car, would they repair it? If the answer is &amp;amp;quot;no&amp;amp;quot;, then fight your insurance company because you&amp;amp;#39;re about to get a raw deal..and possibly end up with a vehicle that&amp;amp;#39;s now dangerous and also possibly worthless to any lender or any future buyer (or any future insurance payout..)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You may be able to smell it on your new clothes. It&amp;amp;#39;s recommended that you wash all garments that will come into direct contact with your skin.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Let&amp;amp;#39;s say 8 years ago you quit a job. Later, that business discovered you were owed $50 in overtime. Legally, they have to get it to you, but realistically they aren&amp;amp;#39;t going to hire a PI to find &amp;amp;amp; verify your identity. Maybe you inherited some stocks/bonds and weren&amp;amp;#39;t notified. Where does the money go? Why, the Unclaimed Property Program! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I found I was owed hundreds of dollars from my college apartment. My best friend was owed about $75 from an old gig. My current employer had cash from an overpaid utility bill.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s your money and it&amp;amp;#39;s free to get it back. There are BILLIONS OF DOLLARS left unclaimed in the US every year.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is not a scam. I get nothing from this. You won&amp;amp;#39;t be asked to pay a dime - if you are, it&amp;amp;#39;s a scam website. Every state has its own. You can search anywhere - make sure to search in states you&amp;amp;#39;ve lived in the past.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Causes:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The etiology of ingrown toenails includes direct trauma to the toe that forces the nail corners into the surrounding nail fold, genetic predisposition, improper nail trimming, poorly fitting shoes, and constant and repetitive microtrauma from normal day-to-day activities. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Turn off the water&amp;amp;#39;s supply to the toilet&amp;amp;#39;s water tank, there&amp;amp;#39;s usually a knob or valve on the wall next to your toilet that you have to turn.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Open up the water tank/cistern by removing the top lid. (You may need a screwdriver to do this, depending on the model of your toilet)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;If the water tank is full, flush the water and empty it. (Because you&amp;amp;#39;ve turned off the water&amp;amp;#39;s supply, it shouldn&amp;amp;#39;t fill back up again)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Pour white vinegar all over the flushing system and fill half of the tank with it.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Fill the remaining half of the tank with hot water (not boiling, slightly hot, max 50°C/120°F temp) and let the mixture do its thing for 15-20 minutes. You should be able to see small bubbles, that&amp;amp;#39;s a result of the white vinegar dissolving the deposits.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;If you have thick hard deposits, wear latex gloves and use a sponge to scrape off the deposits.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Once all the deposits have dissolved, flush it all down the toilet.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Turn the water&amp;amp;#39;s supply to the toilet&amp;amp;#39;s tank back on and put the lid back on.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Do this once a month, or maybe even once a week, depending on how calcareous your tap water is.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;ve just had to clean mine thoroughly because my toilet&amp;amp;#39;s flushing system stopped working properly, the water kept flushing/running. When I opened up the lid of the water tank, I was pretty horrified by the state of the flushing system. I had to replace the gaskets and had to scrape a lot of thick deposits. It was a real pain to clean... So, I now have a reminder in my phone to pour white vinegar into the toilet&amp;amp;#39;s water tank once a month to prevent this.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hopefully this is useful to someone!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

If you&amp;amp;#39;re having a hard time getting bleach to work as you&amp;amp;#39;d expect, think back to how long ago you bought it, as it could be almost completely inert if it&amp;amp;#39;s a few years old.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
