&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I often see people causally mentioning the inconvenience of their cat vomiting on their floor, as if it is a normal part of cat behaviour.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It isn&amp;amp;#39;t.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cats will throw up occasionally - typically because of a fur ball or having eaten too quickly, but it isn&amp;amp;#39;t normal for them to be doing it as frequently as &amp;amp;quot;once every few weeks&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cats can often vomit because:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You aren&amp;amp;#39;t grooming your cat enough, therefore fur balls are forming and will eventually be expelled (a complete brush once a week should be sufficient in minimising this)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is eating too quickly, playing too soon after eating, or both&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You are changing their food too frequently - you should find a food that works (ask your vet) and stick with it&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If none of these reasons sound like they could be the cause of your cat vomiting, then you should take it to the vet and get it checked out - it could be a sign of an underlying illness, intolerance to a specific food, or exposure to something toxic (some houseplants can be culprits).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also, for goodness sake, don&amp;amp;#39;t give your cat chocolate or anything that isn&amp;amp;#39;t strictly edible for cats (Google if in doubt).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

You should know google password manager is a browser-based manager and linked to your browser&amp;amp;#39;s data like history/cookies/cache, so it can be cleared accidentally and easily. A third party app (lastpass, keeper, 1password, etc.) is a true password manager and much better choice. Other things to note if you&amp;amp;#39;re new to tech-security and want to be better: Google&amp;amp;#39;s auto-generating feature only creates relatively simple passwords and you cannot change the requirements/length. It is &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;only&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; available with chrome, while third party managers are separate entities and have apps/extensions. Being linked to google, someone would only need one password on one of your devices to access them &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;all&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How did I learn this? Well, I absent-mindedly cleared my history along with all other data in the advanced settings to help try and debug an app. Next thing I know, the entirety of 2+ years of saved passwords, most of which are auto-generated, are gone! Don&amp;amp;#39;t be like me. But if you do want to stick with google pw manager, make sure to back them up. There is an option to download a .csv file with all your passwords if you want to move them to another manager. That introduces a whole other layer of risk, so be careful.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It seems to me based on films I have seen, many of them are unknowingly promoting rape culture. In one very popular film I rewatched recently (Superbad), Jonah hill jokes that parties are for getting girls really drunk so they’ll sleep with you.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With recent personal events this shocked me that such a popular film would joke about something like that and normalise it. If you sleep with someone (whether it’s a man/woman) who is blackout drunk and likely would never even consider sleeping with you sober THAT IS RAPE, there was no consent.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you’re still reading also please read up on symptoms of Rohypnol/ GHB (date rape drugs). Many people think being spiked looks like you’re really drunk, unable to speak or walk but the reality is often VERY different. They can make you euphoric, lose inhibition, increase sense of connection with others, influence decision making and increase libido. If the spiker knows what they’re doing it can be so hard to spot and it’s so important to look out for your friends and ANY indication they may have been spiked GET TESTED ASAP. These drugs only stay in your system for a few hours and we need to start catching these bastards!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Take care, have a good Christmas for those who celebrate it :)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Please stop making this a gender thing, I literally say man/woman&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My post has actually shocked me seeing this level of hatred in the comments and comments saying “well what about &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;insert men’s issue&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;” NOT EVERYTHING IS A MENS VS WOMEN COMPETITION &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I don’t comment on posts about men’s mental health and suicide rates saying “oh yeah well women are more likely to get raped so that’s the real issue”ygm?? They’re BOTH issues, let them both exist&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My sister and her husband could&amp;amp;#39;ve died.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I overheard my sister telling our mom that she is still losing hair and can&amp;amp;#39;t figure out why - this is red flag #1, but it didn&amp;amp;#39;t click in my brain at that point.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Several hours later, my sister was having a discussion with our dad.  For the sake of brevity, here are the important parts:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Dad (joking): &amp;amp;quot;It sounds like your house is haunted!&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sister: &amp;amp;quot;It literally is haunted.  I see ghosts all the time.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;click&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Me: &amp;amp;quot;Do you have a CO detector in your house?&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sister: &amp;amp;quot;No.  Why?&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Long story short, her house did indeed have a CO leak.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Other symptoms her and her husband were experiencing:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Dull headache&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Weakness&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Dizziness&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Nausea&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These symptoms had gone on for so long that they just accepted them as a normal part of life.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Additional symptoms can be found &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/carbon-monoxide/symptoms-causes/syc-20370642&quot;&amp;gt;here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://whippleplumbing.com/low-exposure-carbon-monoxide-poisoning/&quot;&amp;gt;here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you or someone you know are inexplicably experiencing any of these symptoms: get the hell out of the house IMMEDIATELY and pick up a CO detector, then call a plumber if it goes off.  You could potentially save lives.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit:  Forgot to mention - Symptoms go away after leaving the house for a while, such as visiting family.  My sister and her husband said they feel great when they aren&amp;amp;#39;t in the house.  This is another significant indicator of CO poisoning.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;-depending on your state&amp;amp;#39;s public real estate records and laws, predatory companies may be able to see whenever your new deed or mortgage is filed into public record when you purchase a property or refinance a mortgage. They have algorithms set up to comb through newly filed public records and automatically send mailers to every new homeowner or newly refinanced borrower. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;-these predatory companies will spam mail you with offers to send copies of your documents for an exorbitant price which you can otherwise get for free or very inexpensively&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;-(by the way, other predatory companies will spam mail you with life insurance offers to pay off your new mortgage (even if you refinance) if you die. I just refinanced and got no less than 12 mailers across 2 weeks.) &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;-you should never pay any 3rd party company for copies of your deed and mortgage if you buy or refinance a house. Your title company should send copies to you free of charge or for a few dollars. You can also obtain them from the local public record authority for a small charge compared to the insane fees charges by the predatory mail companies. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is so insidious because most people don&amp;amp;#39;t know how real estate records work. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There&amp;amp;#39;s nothing illegal about what these companies do, but it&amp;amp;#39;s very unethical. It costs them 50 cents to mail you a letter, makes you think you need to get the service from them, and if you give them hundreds of dollars for their &amp;amp;quot;service&amp;amp;quot; then they just made 99.9% profit. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you need any paperwork after your closing, contact your title company, bank, insurance company, or whatever service provider you&amp;amp;#39;ve already engaged. Don&amp;amp;#39;t fall victim to the public record profiteers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And if you need life insurance to pay off your mortgage if you die-- don&amp;amp;#39;t buy it from them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s a powerful statement, because people usually just call to complain. A compliment speaks loudly. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s good for the businesses too, to have workers that are pleasant. Everyone benefits from them rewarding solid and friendly employees. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

While for some trades may be the best way to a successful future, this does not hold true for everyone. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I’ve trained dozens of people and watched at least %80 wash out after claiming they could handle it. Why? It’s hard, depressing, you’re going to miss your family get no thanks, and it’s out right demoralizing until you’ve mastered it unless you’re a true die hard country boy or handy man. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you or your child considers trade work you have to be In perfect physical condition to even have a shot at the big bucks(some, or most tbh, forego that for hard drugs to cope). There is no I’m tired or hungry when you’re at the mercy of people that have done this for years. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I will not quit my trade although I am in the process of getting an education. I take pride in building. Aliens didn’t build the pyramids people like you and I  did. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;25 years ago, when we all got our first &amp;amp;#39;real jobs&amp;amp;#39; out of college, I remember many of my mates bragging about their company-funded golf games and company-expensed dinners and amazing Christmas bonuses. In retrospect I think most of them were exaggerating/lying, but I always wondered why I never had those perks.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Come Christmas, my immediate manager (we were a team of 12) went around and gave envelopes to everyone. &amp;amp;#39;Here&amp;amp;#39;s the fat Christmas bonus I hear everyone talk about&amp;amp;#39;, I thought to myself.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I open the envelope and see a $15 gift certificate to a retail store. &amp;amp;#39;That&amp;amp;#39;s it?&amp;amp;#39; I thought to myself &amp;amp;#39;I bust my chops all day for $15?&amp;amp;#39; I was livid.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I was livid all the way home. Livid that evening. Livid that weekend. I told my gf how livid I was. I expected her to be livid along with me.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Instead, she said &amp;amp;quot;That was nice of her, spending her own money like that.&amp;amp;quot; That&amp;amp;#39;s when I realized that this wasn&amp;amp;#39;t a cheap gift, but an amazing, thoughtful gift. I was so obsessed with myself, that I didn&amp;amp;#39;t realize that we were the only team to get something.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My manager - who wasn&amp;amp;#39;t getting paid much more than us, but who had way more financial responsibilities than us - took it upon herself to go out and get each of her team something with her own money - almost $200.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I felt terrible for feeling the way I did, but it taught me a valuable lesson in life.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Happy holidays, everyone!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I worked as a data scientist in big tech, and observed that data deletion is tricky business. Data governance laws vary by country and even state, and range quite widely. In some jurisdictions, there are no requirements: a company owns the data generated through your interactions with its services. Other countries/states do have data ownership/privacy requirements, but even the most stringent laws often require that data not be actually deleted.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Many large companies retain data for &amp;amp;quot;compliance&amp;amp;quot; reasons. A request to delete personal data, while often honored for marketing purposes by companies seeking to operate legally (not all do), is often considered legally compliant if a company only locks your data away rather than deletes it. Data access in these cases is usually limited to a handful of people dedicated to the data privacy compliance effort, but the data is often kept for months and even years. This is not a company&amp;amp;#39;s fault, but rather is mandated by other laws--ones that help identify corruption, market manipulation, anti-consumer actions, etc.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While retaining data is useful for the above reasons, this legal mess can create confusion for ordinary people. In practice, your data is often accessible even after a company &amp;amp;quot;deletes&amp;amp;quot; it. Given that data breaches in today&amp;amp;#39;s world are effectively only a matter of time at any given company, you can pretty much assume that any online interaction you make can one day surface. Companies do have an obligation to try to keep this from happening, but can seldom be counted on as software often relies on hundreds and thousands of other pieces of software as dependencies--consistently updating all of which is incredibly difficult.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Cats are natural predators, and as a result are the largest and most abundant invasive predator of birds in the US. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Feral cats number over 50M in the US, equating to about &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;8 billion&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; small game hunts per year, most of which are small song birds.(2.4 billion) &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Why is this important to me?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;a single mating pair of cats can produce 400,000 offspring in 7 years&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;cats kill about 50% of songbird fledglings (baby birds)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; they will never recover at this rate&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;a UNebraska study has pinned 33 bird extinction events on cat predation&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Humans&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, almost 8 billion of us and our cars, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;are responsible for about 400M deaths of song-birds annually, cats are 2.4 billion&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This issue is 100% to blame on irresponsible cat owners because they are an invasive species brought here by pet trade. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

If given early enough, Naloxone can reverse the effects of an opioid overdose and restore normal breathing. It works by turning off opioid receptors in the brain, meaning it has no effects on someone who isn&amp;amp;#39;t being affected by opioids.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In my home state of Minnesota, most pharmacies give it out for free. No special training is required.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Note that it is a controlled substance, so you will need a prescription in some states. More info below. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How Does Naloxone Work?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Naloxone is an opioid receptor antagonist meaning it binds to opioid receptors and reverses or blocks the effects of other opioids. Giving naloxone rapidly reverses the effects of opioid drugs, restoring normal respiration. It can be administered by injection or through a nasal spray.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Is Naloxone Safe?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yes. There is no evidence of significant adverse reactions to naloxone. Administering naloxone in cases of opioid overdose can cause withdrawal symptoms when the person is dependent on opioids; this is uncomfortable without being life threatening. The risk that someone overdosing on opioids will have a serious adverse reaction to naloxone is far less than their risk of dying from overdose. Naloxone works if a person has opioids in their system and has no harmful effect if opioids are absent. Naloxone should be given to any person who shows signs of an opioid overdose or when an overdose is suspected.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fully white canes can be used by any visually impaired person. They are often used as a signal to others. My dad is legally blind, but doesn&amp;amp;#39;t need the cane to generally walk around. However, he uses it outside to make crossing the street easier. In most places, you are required to stop for people with a white cane (or guide dog).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also, white canes with a red tip are for people who are deaf blind.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I know this was posted 6 years ago, but I saw some thread of people arguing about if a person with a white cane could see someone in front of them. Sometimes they can !&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Some companies will even let you carry over a certain amount of days into the following year (although that is becoming increasingly rare these days). If you are allowed 3 weeks per year and you are allowed to carry over 1 week per year, over the course of 5 years, you could build up a pretty substantial amount of accrued PTO. If you leave the company, they have to make you whole… in other words, that company is required to pay back all your accrued vacation time at the end of your employment. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However, with an unlimited vacation policy, no vacation time is accrued at any point throughout the year. So if you had a really stressful year which didn’t allow you to take PTO and the company lays you off in December, you receive nothing. In the 3 week PTO example, the company would have to comp you almost 3 weeks of accrued vacation time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also, there is a psychological component in play as well. If employees are given unlimited PTO, most take less time off throughout any given year. If a company says you HAVE to take 3 weeks this year (no carryover), you’re going to plan out that time off. If unlimited, you always think that you’ll get around to planning time off but then that always gets delayed. As one who can speak from experience in my current company, I make sure to assign myself X number of days off per year and track to that. Believe me, it helps.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Just remember, a lot of companies are not “cool” or progressive with these perks that make them seem more attractive, they are usually tactics that somehow benefit their bottom lines in the end.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;(Seeing a lot of comments about policies outside of US. Apologies, I should have clarified that all my experience is within US based companies. I am not surprised for a second that other countries take better care of their workforce)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I saw a video showing household tips &amp;amp;amp; tricks and they used petroleum jelly (Vaseline) to lubricate the doors and now (2 years later) they still slide along effortlessly. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You have to be tall enough to reach the top of the door. There are usually a two brackets up on top with a small wheel that rides along a rail. If you can&amp;amp;#39;t see it you can move your door back &amp;amp;amp; forth slowly and feel around with your finger until you come across a little wheel spinning. Take some petroleum jelly on the end of your finger and touch it to the wheel as you move the door slowly. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The wheel will spread the jelly on the rail and use it up, which is what you want to happen. You should  have to use about 3 dabs to cover the rail &amp;amp;amp; wheel really well. Move the door as far as you can one way then the other. Repeat with the other bracket. Then repeat on the two brackets on the other door. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When you are done with the jelly just use the door handle to move the doors back &amp;amp;amp; forth as far as you can about a dozen times. This makes sure the lubricant is spread the entire length of the rails. You should already notice how easily it is gliding along. If not, then you have other problems. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Why YSK: A sliding door has moving pieces just like hinges move on swinging doors and need lubrication. Most people don&amp;amp;#39;t think about lubricating the moving pieces because they are hidden. You won&amp;amp;#39;t believe how easily some will open &amp;amp;amp; shut afterwards.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As someone who has worked numerous fast food jobs, I can tell you these are some of the absolute worst working conditions in America. I have worked at Popeye&amp;amp;#39;s, Jack in the Box, and Burger King. Do you like being tremendously under-compensated for your work? Then fast food is for you. Popeye&amp;amp;#39;s paid $10/hr, Burger King paid $9.50, Jack in the Box paid $9. Now imagine you work an 8 hour shift at Jack in the Box and come away with $70 for your efforts. They&amp;amp;#39;re making $70 in sales &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;within 100 seconds.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; Seriously, it takes them 2-3 sales to earn what you get paid over an entire 8 hour shift. The pay is insulting and impossible to live off of.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Oh, and that&amp;amp;#39;s not all. While the tasks may be &amp;amp;quot;easy&amp;amp;quot;, they are CONSTANT. Imagine making dozens and dozens and dozens of sandwiches in  a row, and the line never slows down or ceases. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;I have made food poorly out of spite, and so have my coworkers. You should know that if you join an already long line, thus putting more stress on grossly underpaid workers, they may make your food poorly out of frustration.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; And that&amp;amp;#39;s not all. Most fast food places don&amp;amp;#39;t offer a break. You&amp;amp;#39;re expected to work 8 hours straight, only getting to rest when the line stops.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And that&amp;amp;#39;s not all either. The conditions are poor. You&amp;amp;#39;re surrounded by multiple fryers, causing the air in the restaurant to get hot and humid, causing you to sweat. Not only that, but the air is filled with grease and you will feel gross by the end of your shift. Not to mention that eating the unhealthy food on a daily basis can lead to weight gain and health problems. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Not here&amp;amp;#39;s another kicker. Because you are working in a low-paying industry that will basically hire anyone, you are going to meet some bad people.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; I worked with a man who would literally clock in, go to the manager&amp;amp;#39;s office (This was the overnight so there was no manager there), and just go to sleep. Then he&amp;amp;#39;d wake up, call his girlfriend, and start screaming at her. This was a nightly occurrence. Another guy I worked with frequently went to the bathroom to do meth and crack. He was homeless, spent his checks on drugs, and would get so high he would spend the entire shift talking to himself. He called women &amp;amp;quot;Skynet&amp;amp;quot; and said he needed to take them out, and asked me where to get a gun. Another woman and her boyfriend quit after his repeated abuse. There are plenty of bad people in fast food.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Ok, ok, I get it, you don&amp;amp;#39;t care about the working conditions. All you want is a decent meal. Let me tell you about the things I&amp;amp;#39;ve seen.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; I&amp;amp;#39;ve seen sandwich buns dropped on the floor, and instead of throwing them away, the employee will continue to make the sandwich with those buns. I&amp;amp;#39;ve seen entire buckets of raw chicken dropped onto the ground, only to be thrown in the fryer instead of the garbage. I&amp;amp;#39;ve seen swarms and swarms of flies in the kitchen, both at Popeye&amp;amp;#39;s and Burger King. Most of the time, employees didn&amp;amp;#39;t wear gloves, they made the food with their bare hands. Those are just a few examples, and I&amp;amp;#39;m sure I could think of more if I tried.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Do you know the signs?
1. The leader is the ultimate authority
If you’re not allowed to criticize your leader, even if the criticism is true, you’re probably in a cult.
2. The group suppresses skepticism
If you’re only allowed to study your organization through approved sources, you’re probably in a cult. Cults view critical thinking as an infectious disease and every effort is made to suppress it. Doubting members are encouraged to isolate themselves from outside influences and focus solely on the doctrine of the cult
4. The group is paranoid about the outside world
5. The group relies on shame cycles
6. The leader is above the law 
7. The group uses “thought reform” methods
If your serious questions are answered with cliches, you’re probably in a cult.
8. The group is elitist
If your group is the solution for all the world’s problems, you’re probably in a cult.
Cults see themselves as the enlightened, chosen, and elect organization tasked with radically transforming individual lives and the entire world.
9. Tell you to stay away from friends and family with different views.
10. No financial transparency&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In simplistic terms: 50% chance of rain means that it is expected that 50% of a certain area is expected to see rain.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The formula to calculate Precipitation Chance (%) = Confidence of Precipitation Developing x Percent of Area Affected.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If the confidence level is 100% then a 30% chance of rain means that 30% of the coverage area will see precipitation. If the confidence level is 50% and only 40% of the coverage area will see precipitation, then the math is (0.50 x 0.40) x 100 = 20 or 20% chance of rain. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

What many may not realize is the impact of that kind of behavior has long term effects on one&amp;amp;#39;s self esteem, view of relationships, mental health (negative core self beliefs, trauma, PTSD/CPTSD, anxiety, depression, etc etc) and needs as a person. Thats why its important to stop the cycle and learn to communicate properly. Healing is definitely possible.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It doesn&amp;amp;#39;t matter how well they treat you after or how sincerely they apologize. It doesn&amp;amp;#39;t matter if they are your parents or guardians. This is not normal healthy behavior. Healthy relationships involve talking about problems and working things out. There is no hurtful name-calling or blaming things on the other person. If they are willing to call you names to get a rise out of you on purpose, how do you think that will work out with children or years down the line?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Its hard enough to find a relationship, I get it, but yelling and screaming happen when there is not enough healthy communication. 9/10 times situations that involve yelling or screaming could be solved by a calm, emotionally mature, and honest conversation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you know you do this, own it. Talk to a therapist about why and work on it. You will be so much happier and healthier when you can communicate your feelings through talking rather than the less effective and more hurtful mode of verbal violence&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

It is in her own best interest to move you right on through to the dining room, so please be assured that if there was anything she can do to lower your wait time, she would do it. She does not deserved to be yelled at because your wait is 15 minutes longer than you expected. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Pretty much every restaurant is woefully understaffed right now. Those that survived the last couple of years are trying to operate as lean as possible. Until the restaurant industry has time to recover, this is likely to remain the case. Even then, I imagine they will have a tough time attracting enough workers to become fully staffed unless they make dramatic improvements to how their employees are compensated. The hostess that you are taking your frustrations out on is one of, if not the lowest paid, employees in the restaurant, and in many cases it is their very first job. With the staffing situation the way it is now, she is very likely having to bus tables, answer the phone, pack to-go orders, and do cleanliness checks on the restrooms, as well as manage the waitlist and coordinate the seating of diners. On top of that, she is going to be the first one to get grief from her managers when customers start to pile up waiting to be seated.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The hostess at a restaurant cannot seat you if there isn’t a table available for you. It’s as simple as that. Just because you see an empty table, or a dozen empty tables, doesn’t mean that there are enough servers on duty to work those tables. The hostess cannot put you at a table that doesn’t have a server assigned to it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you MUST yell at someone, first of all, get some psychiatric help at the first opportunity, but until then maybe yell at other diners who loiter for an hour after their meal is finished. Or yell at the manager, who at least to some degree has some control over how the restaurant is staffed at any given time. Maybe write a scathing email or make an irate phone call to the corporate office, if it’s a chain, or the owner if it’s privately owned, and insist that they raise wages or do whatever they need to do to attract more staff.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Please, if you are not capable of being patient and showing a little bit of grace, please just eat at home. You never know the battles someone else is fighting in their life, and your harsh words at that particular time may have an impact that on them that you never intended.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;During a stroke, both men and women typically report these signs appearing suddenly:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- Numbness or weakness in the face, arm or leg, especially on one side of the body&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- Confusion, trouble speaking or trouble understanding&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- Trouble seeing in one or both eyes&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- Difficulty walking, dizziness, or loss of balance or coordination&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- Severe headache with no known cause&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Women, however, may also report these symptoms:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- Hiccups&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- Nausea&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- Chest pain&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- Fatigue&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- Shortness of breath&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- A racing heartbeat&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s worth knowing in case a friend or a loved one is ever showing any of these signs as you need to act quickly!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Do not keep their items in your pocket unless you are related to that casualty. That may come off as you stealing it. It&amp;amp;#39;s best to leave it on the floor next to the casualty so everyone can see who picks up the wallet.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In a scenario where everyone is gathering around, no one would dare to pick up the casualty&amp;amp;#39;s wallet while it&amp;amp;#39;s very noticeable.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As someone living near a junction where the traffic is confusing and prone to accidents, people stealing money/valuables from the casualty has happened more times than I can count.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
