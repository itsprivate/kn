&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Recent research (see &amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/research-reports/marijuana/there-link-between-marijuana-use-psychiatric-disorders#akt1&quot;&amp;gt;AKT1 Gene Variations and Psychosis&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;) has found that people who use marijuana and carry a specific variant of the &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;AKT1&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; gene, which codes for an enzyme that affects dopamine signaling in the &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;striatum&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, are at increased risk of developing psychosis&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

One involes non-profit organizations that ostensibly educate and support the public, then turn around and &amp;amp;quot;sell&amp;amp;quot; referrals to treatment centers for personal profit (sometimes laundered as &amp;amp;quot;you can buy advertising on our website&amp;amp;quot; or &amp;amp;quot;you can sponsor our events financially for a certain number of patients per quarter&amp;amp;quot;). This violates numerous ethical rules and means that the community organizations that claim to be working in the public interest, but some who benefit from the non-profit tax status also have thriving direct income from selling your loved ones into centers that may not be the right fit for their needs. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The other more publicized version are the internal and external &amp;amp;quot;treatment loops&amp;amp;quot; maintained between inpatient and outpatient centers. Essentially either one owner holds both centers, and they count on you relapsing in the lower level of care to send you back up to the higher level of care in and endless loop that ends in your death, or the inpatient facility partners with a series of poorly-run outpatient facilities or &amp;amp;quot;recovery homes&amp;amp;quot; that are either negligently or in some cases intentionally inviting relapse, then rushing you back through to the feeder system of inpatient care...is you survive. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Why YSK: Because this can contribute to the relapse and death of you or a loved one. America has a complicated and complex issue with addiction, but this aspect is a part of the problem, and is not nearly well-known enough and gets ignored when the federal government releases millions of dollars in new grants, that then sadly often go to those exact organizations that continue to prop up more of the same kinds of cyclical addiction factories. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Please, do your own research and choose the centers that specialize in the kids of issues you or your loved one suffer from, and don&amp;amp;#39;t blindly take the word of community outreach personnel that may or may not have a vested financial interest in treatment failure.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

But then I see them just slicing garlic into millimeter slices in their recipe. Right.. found the problem. Most of the time the recipe is fine, you just have to prepare the garlic correctly in order to get the right amount of flavor you want. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The way you chop and cook garlic affects the strength of the flavor in your dish. If you mince garlic you will release much more flavor compared to slices. A paste will be even stronger (you get a paste by mincing first and then smearing it on the cutting board using a knife repeatedly) &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also, cooking garlic less will retain more of its flavor. If your garlic is being sautéed until brown, you won’t taste it as much. If you want a strong flavor make sure you add it late and keep it white.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

It might make you seem less professional especially if you work from home. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My suggestion is to sing along to a song before you get on your first call, and usually that will warm up your vocal chords enough to get rid of your sleepy creaky voice.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;edit: I think a lot of people dislike this post because they’re conflating how things should be with how things are. When you work from home people don’t have all the same data as they do if they can see you, read your body language, and see how hard you’re working. They don’t know what kind of day you’ve had. All people have to go off of is what you type, how you sound, and what work you get done. I genuinely believe how you sound is important if you’re customer-facing. I’m trying to help you!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

There are shovels built to lift, shovels built to push, and those made to do both&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; (like the Head &amp;amp;amp; Shoulders of shovels).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For lighter snowfall, you will appreciate having a wider (30&amp;amp;quot; or 36&amp;amp;quot;) snow pusher that is lower profile and allows you to easily move light snow and cover more ground quickly.  These shovels are best in 3&amp;amp;quot; or less.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For the end of the driveway after the plow has come through, use a bucket style (or &amp;amp;quot;combination&amp;amp;quot;)  shovel to lift heavier and more compact snow that you need to lift &amp;amp;amp; carry to it&amp;amp;#39;s spot.  If there is big-time accumulation, you&amp;amp;#39;ll be happy to have a scooping shovel (similar to what you may see on a farm) that can more easily grab deep snow. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There are plenty of other designs as well for ergonomics,  bad backs and dual-hand placement and even one I&amp;amp;#39;ve seen with wheels, so do a little research to find whatever is right for you.  But my message is about owning &amp;amp;amp; having an assortment of 2-3 different shovels for different types of snow accumulation throughout the season.  Shoveling snow is wildly easier for me these days than my first year of homeownership when I just had one basic combination shovel I bought on the cheap.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

But the health risks are clear, and smoke from a wood fire damages your respiratory system and heart in a similar fashion to cigarette smoking. Light fires frequently enough and it can become much worse.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireplace#Health_effects&quot;&amp;gt;Wikipedia&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; summary perfectly describes how bad it is:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With regard to adults, studies show that prolonged inhalation of &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood_smoke&quot;&amp;gt;wood smoke&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; contributed to &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchitis#Chronic_bronchitis&quot;&amp;gt;chronic bronchitis&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, chronic interstitial &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_disease&quot;&amp;gt;lung disease&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_arterial_hypertension&quot;&amp;gt;pulmonary arterial hypertension&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Corpulmonale&amp;amp;amp;action=edit&amp;amp;amp;redlink=1&quot;&amp;gt;corpulmonale&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; (Pulmonary heart disease), and altered pulmonary immune defense mechanisms. While adverse effects on adults are notable, children appear to be at greatest risk. Many studies that focused specifically on RWC [Residential Wood Combustion] have concluded that young children living in homes heated by a wood-burning stove had a greater occurrence of moderate and severe chronic respiratory symptoms than children of the same age and sex who did not live in homes heated with a wood burning stove. Exposure of preschool children living in homes heated with wood burning stoves or in houses with open fireplaces yielded these effects: decreased pulmonary &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung&quot;&amp;gt;lung&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; function in young &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthmatics&quot;&amp;gt;asthmatics&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;; increased incidence of acute &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchitis&quot;&amp;gt;bronchitis&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and severity/frequency of &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheezing&quot;&amp;gt;wheezing&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coughing&quot;&amp;gt;coughing&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;; and increased incidence, duration, and possibly severity of acute &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_infections&quot;&amp;gt;respiratory infections&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. Residential wood combustion &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhaust_gas&quot;&amp;gt;emissions&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; also contain &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_sulfur_oxides&quot;&amp;gt;sulfur oxides&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_oxides&quot;&amp;gt;nitrogen oxides&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide&quot;&amp;gt;carbon monoxide&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and potentially &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenic&quot;&amp;gt;carcinogenic&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; compounds including &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbons&quot;&amp;gt;polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzene&quot;&amp;gt;benzene&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formaldehyde&quot;&amp;gt;formaldehyde&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dioxins_and_dioxin-like_compounds&quot;&amp;gt;dioxins&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. Some of these pollutants are known to cause cancer but their effects on human health via exposure to wood smoke have not been extensively studied.&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireplace#cite_note-9&quot;&amp;gt;[9]&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;The Washington State Department of Ecology also published a booklet explaining why wood smoke can be dangerous. It explains that human lung and &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system&quot;&amp;gt;respiratory systems&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; are unable to filter &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates&quot;&amp;gt;particulates&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; emitted by wood combustion, which penetrate deeply into the lungs. For months, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogen&quot;&amp;gt;carcinogens&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; can continue to cause changes and structural damage within the respiratory system. Young children, seniors, pregnant women, smokers and individuals with &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease&quot;&amp;gt;respiratory diseases&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; are most vulnerable. Wood smoke can cause disease and even death in children, because it is associated with &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_respiratory_tract_infection&quot;&amp;gt;lower respiratory tract infections&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireplace#cite_note-Ecology-3&quot;&amp;gt;[3]&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; Home fireplaces have caused fatal &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide_poisoning&quot;&amp;gt;carbon monoxide poisoning&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireplace#cite_note-10&quot;&amp;gt;[10]&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The smoke from wood burning is made up of a complex mixture of gases and fine particles (also called particle pollution, particulate matter, or PM). In addition to particle pollution, wood smoke contains several toxic air pollutants including: benzene, formaldehyde, acrolein, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://heart.org/&quot;&amp;gt;Heart.org&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3685524/&quot;&amp;gt;2013 study&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; in the journal &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Particle and Fibre Toxicology&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; found exposure to wood smoke causes the arteries to become stiffer, which raises the risk of dangerous cardiac events. For pregnant women, a &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30253313&quot;&amp;gt;2019 study&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; in &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Environmental Research&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; connected wood smoke exposure to a higher risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, which include preeclampsia and gestational high blood pressure.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Why YSK: I thought that this would be a good YSK since it is the winter holidays, and a wood fire is anchored in our mind as a part of a picture-perfect holiday evening. But the truth is that they are completely awful, and many of us in modern society are still completely naïve to this fact. Just like led-based paint, asbestos, and smoking around children, it needs to be on its way out. Some states are already offering tax incentives to replace old fireplaces. Please just use an alternative method of heating if you have it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you need to save cash to get away from an abusive partner who has financial control- use grocery trips to put away money a little at a time. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If your partner will not see/check the itemized receipt, just get cash back when checking out and save that cash somewhere safe. Bank statements will show the total grocery store bill without showing any cash was withdrawn. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If your partner does check the itemized receipt, many stores now have free apps to clip digital coupons- my local store (giant) will give cash back for any digital coupons that did not properly come off during check out. Any coupons not “clipped” at least 30 minutes before a check out have to be manually paid out. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I got $15 cash back from customer service today that will not show up on any receipt or bank statement. Thankfully this is not something I need to worry about , but I thought it may help someone in a difficult situation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Why YSK&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;: Many people bought Tiles over the years because they wanted a good quality convenient bluetooth tracking device for their keys or valuables. With the introduction of Apple&amp;amp;#39;s Airtags and Galaxy SmartTags, Tile has been under a lot of pressure with their extremely limited network. Now that their parent company has switched to one whose philosophy is radically different, those who bought Tiles in the past should reconsider if they want to continue using those products and potentially lose out on a large part of their privacy.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also something Tile customers may want to know is that Mark Zuckerberg&amp;amp;#39;s sister sits on Life360&amp;amp;#39;s &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://investors.life360.com/investor-relations/?page=board-of-directors&quot;&amp;gt;board of directors&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is worth noting that when asked about the parent company change, a Tile representative stated, &amp;amp;quot;Tile does not sell/monetize personal data and we have Life360’s full support and commitment to continue that,&amp;amp;quot; but that remains to be seen.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When you cut someone off in traffic, it’s because you were being absentminded or because you’re late to sing lullabies to your newborn, right?

The excess lint accumulates in the exhaust (the tube in the wall that goes outside) and due to moisture, will build up fairly quickly, so if you clean it once a year, it keeps the buildup to a minimum. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;-Especially if you rent, you never know when the last time was the line was cleaned so it should be one of the first things done before connecting your dryer.-&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In states that go below freezing, and in homes where the exhaust line is low, remember to check to ensure the ice buildup is not getting close to the line. The ice accumulates from the ground up, so if it gets too close, knock it over. Most building codes require new construction to be well off the ground but older homes can have lines close enough that ice buildup can accumulate enough that it reaches the line and you can quickly asphyxiate once the dryer is engaged. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We use the new year as our reminder to change smoke detector batteries, clean furnace and dryer exhausts, etc., and thought it might also help someone else. If you’re uncomfortable performing this task, it is recommended to clean your furnace exhaust bi-yearly and if you ask, an HVAC company will gladly clean your dryer vent, as well.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Source: I work for a company that performs Home maintenance services, and it&amp;amp;#39;s not uncommon to receive packets of bill payment checks. It appears that when banks have multiple clients sending payments to the same company, they will hold the checks and send them all in the same envelope. I regularly receive packets of bill payment checks, with the checks themselves having dates ranging over a space of two weeks. The number of clients who get angry with me for telling him I haven&amp;amp;#39;t received their payment yet, when the bank has given them a date and already withdrawn their funds makes me realize that people don&amp;amp;#39;t understand how bill payment seems to work. The funds don&amp;amp;#39;t come out of your account when the checks are received, they come out of your account when the checks are printed, which is not necessarily even when they are mailed out.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Note that this may not apply to all bank bill pay systems and you should contact your individual bank for more details.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I often see people causally mentioning the inconvenience of their cat vomiting on their floor, as if it is a normal part of cat behaviour.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It isn&amp;amp;#39;t.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cats will throw up occasionally - typically because of a fur ball or having eaten too quickly, but it isn&amp;amp;#39;t normal for them to be doing it as frequently as &amp;amp;quot;once every few weeks&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cats can often vomit because:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You aren&amp;amp;#39;t grooming your cat enough, therefore fur balls are forming and will eventually be expelled (a complete brush once a week should be sufficient in minimising this)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is eating too quickly, playing too soon after eating, or both&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You are changing their food too frequently - you should find a food that works (ask your vet) and stick with it&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If none of these reasons sound like they could be the cause of your cat vomiting, then you should take it to the vet and get it checked out - it could be a sign of an underlying illness, intolerance to a specific food, or exposure to something toxic (some houseplants can be culprits).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also, for goodness sake, don&amp;amp;#39;t give your cat chocolate or anything that isn&amp;amp;#39;t strictly edible for cats (Google if in doubt).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

You should know google password manager is a browser-based manager and linked to your browser&amp;amp;#39;s data like history/cookies/cache, so it can be cleared accidentally and easily. A third party app (lastpass, keeper, 1password, etc.) is a true password manager and much better choice. Other things to note if you&amp;amp;#39;re new to tech-security and want to be better: Google&amp;amp;#39;s auto-generating feature only creates relatively simple passwords and you cannot change the requirements/length. It is &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;only&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; available with chrome, while third party managers are separate entities and have apps/extensions. Being linked to google, someone would only need one password on one of your devices to access them &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;all&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How did I learn this? Well, I absent-mindedly cleared my history along with all other data in the advanced settings to help try and debug an app. Next thing I know, the entirety of 2+ years of saved passwords, most of which are auto-generated, are gone! Don&amp;amp;#39;t be like me. But if you do want to stick with google pw manager, make sure to back them up. There is an option to download a .csv file with all your passwords if you want to move them to another manager. That introduces a whole other layer of risk, so be careful.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It seems to me based on films I have seen, many of them are unknowingly promoting rape culture. In one very popular film I rewatched recently (Superbad), Jonah hill jokes that parties are for getting girls really drunk so they’ll sleep with you.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With recent personal events this shocked me that such a popular film would joke about something like that and normalise it. If you sleep with someone (whether it’s a man/woman) who is blackout drunk and likely would never even consider sleeping with you sober THAT IS RAPE, there was no consent.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you’re still reading also please read up on symptoms of Rohypnol/ GHB (date rape drugs). Many people think being spiked looks like you’re really drunk, unable to speak or walk but the reality is often VERY different. They can make you euphoric, lose inhibition, increase sense of connection with others, influence decision making and increase libido. If the spiker knows what they’re doing it can be so hard to spot and it’s so important to look out for your friends and ANY indication they may have been spiked GET TESTED ASAP. These drugs only stay in your system for a few hours and we need to start catching these bastards!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Take care, have a good Christmas for those who celebrate it :)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My sister and her husband could&amp;amp;#39;ve died.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I overheard my sister telling our mom that she is still losing hair and can&amp;amp;#39;t figure out why - this is red flag #1, but it didn&amp;amp;#39;t click in my brain at that point.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Several hours later, my sister was having a discussion with our dad.  For the sake of brevity, here are the important parts:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Dad (joking): &amp;amp;quot;It sounds like your house is haunted!&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sister: &amp;amp;quot;It literally is haunted.  I see ghosts all the time.&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;click&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Me: &amp;amp;quot;Do you have a CO detector in your house?&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sister: &amp;amp;quot;No.  Why?&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Long story short, her house did indeed have a CO leak.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Other symptoms her and her husband were experiencing:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Dull headache&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Weakness&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Dizziness&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Nausea&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These symptoms had gone on for so long that they just accepted them as a normal part of life.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Additional symptoms can be found &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/carbon-monoxide/symptoms-causes/syc-20370642&quot;&amp;gt;here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://whippleplumbing.com/low-exposure-carbon-monoxide-poisoning/&quot;&amp;gt;here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you or someone you know are inexplicably experiencing any of these symptoms: get the hell out of the house IMMEDIATELY and pick up a CO detector, then call a plumber if it goes off.  You could potentially save lives.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;-depending on your state&amp;amp;#39;s public real estate records and laws, predatory companies may be able to see whenever your new deed or mortgage is filed into public record when you purchase a property or refinance a mortgage. They have algorithms set up to comb through newly filed public records and automatically send mailers to every new homeowner or newly refinanced borrower. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;-these predatory companies will spam mail you with offers to send copies of your documents for an exorbitant price which you can otherwise get for free or very inexpensively&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;-(by the way, other predatory companies will spam mail you with life insurance offers to pay off your new mortgage (even if you refinance) if you die. I just refinanced and got no less than 12 mailers across 2 weeks.) &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;-you should never pay any 3rd party company for copies of your deed and mortgage if you buy or refinance a house. Your title company should send copies to you free of charge or for a few dollars. You can also obtain them from the local public record authority for a small charge compared to the insane fees charges by the predatory mail companies. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is so insidious because most people don&amp;amp;#39;t know how real estate records work. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There&amp;amp;#39;s nothing illegal about what these companies do, but it&amp;amp;#39;s very unethical. It costs them 50 cents to mail you a letter, makes you think you need to get the service from them, and if you give them hundreds of dollars for their &amp;amp;quot;service&amp;amp;quot; then they just made 99.9% profit. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you need any paperwork after your closing, contact your title company, bank, insurance company, or whatever service provider you&amp;amp;#39;ve already engaged. Don&amp;amp;#39;t fall victim to the public record profiteers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And if you need life insurance to pay off your mortgage if you die-- don&amp;amp;#39;t buy it from them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I’ve trained dozens of people and watched at least %80 wash out after claiming they could handle it. Why? It’s hard, depressing, you’re going to miss your family get no thanks, and it’s out right demoralizing until you’ve mastered it unless you’re a true die hard country boy or handy man. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;25 years ago, when we all got our first &amp;amp;#39;real jobs&amp;amp;#39; out of college, I remember many of my mates bragging about their company-funded golf games and company-expensed dinners and amazing Christmas bonuses. In retrospect I think most of them were exaggerating/lying, but I always wondered why I never had those perks.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Come Christmas, my immediate manager (we were a team of 12) went around and gave envelopes to everyone. &amp;amp;#39;Here&amp;amp;#39;s the fat Christmas bonus I hear everyone talk about&amp;amp;#39;, I thought to myself.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I open the envelope and see a $15 gift certificate to a retail store. &amp;amp;#39;That&amp;amp;#39;s it?&amp;amp;#39; I thought to myself &amp;amp;#39;I bust my chops all day for $15?&amp;amp;#39; I was livid.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I was livid all the way home. Livid that evening. Livid that weekend. I told my gf how livid I was. I expected her to be livid along with me.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Instead, she said &amp;amp;quot;That was nice of her, spending her own money like that.&amp;amp;quot; That&amp;amp;#39;s when I realized that this wasn&amp;amp;#39;t a cheap gift, but an amazing, thoughtful gift. I was so obsessed with myself, that I didn&amp;amp;#39;t realize that we were the only team to get something.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My manager - who wasn&amp;amp;#39;t getting paid much more than us, but who had way more financial responsibilities than us - took it upon herself to go out and get each of her team something with her own money - almost $200.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I felt terrible for feeling the way I did, but it taught me a valuable lesson in life.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Happy holidays, everyone!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
