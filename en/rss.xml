&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some of those can include:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Gum disease, which can increase your risk of developing heart disease.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;If you don&amp;amp;#39;t take care of your mouth, you risk developing a bacterial infection in your bloodstream. This, in turn, can potentially affect your heart (specifically heart valves -- be very careful if you&amp;amp;#39;ve had heart surgery to repair/replace them).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Poor dental care can lead to type 2 diabetes, and there&amp;amp;#39;s an apparent link between type 2 and cardiovascular disease.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s worth noting that more research is needed to determine exactly what the links are, why they occur and how prevalent they are. But studies seem to indicate that they do, at the very least, exist in some capacity, and you can never be too careful when it comes to your health (especially not with your heart).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Practice good dental hygiene by doing some or, ideally, all of the following:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Brushing your teeth twice a day for 2 minutes at a time (make sure you are brushing all the way to the back).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Flossing once a day.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Using mouthwash frequently.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;If possible, use toothpaste with or drink water that contains fluoride.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;See a dentist regularly for check-ups and cleanings.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Obviously, you can have heart issues regardless of the state of your teeth. And if you &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;do&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; have heart issues (of any kind, whether congenital or adult), it&amp;amp;#39;s still important to maintain good oral hygiene so that you don&amp;amp;#39;t potentially make those problems worse.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Regardless, it&amp;amp;#39;s still a good idea to brush your teeth twice a day. It keeps more than just your mouth happy!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When considering paying $0.27 per serving vs $0.14 per serving, you should know that there is very little difference (if any) between most brands and their off-brand, and often times the difference is that the &amp;amp;quot;off-brand&amp;amp;quot; retains the better tasting original recipe vs the name brand Cereals cost-cutting, recipe changing, etc;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Name Brand cereal seems better due to their superior marketing, however in almost every instance (depending on the off-brand) the non-name brand cereal beats the name brand cereal in blind taste tests.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This means that their marketing is working, however they are in reality NOT better, in almost every instance.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Note:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; I &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;know&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; there are some cereal off-brands out there which clearly do not match/beat the name brand, however for the most part, the majority of them are identical or better than the original.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And... &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;With Kellogg firing 1400 workers rather than providing better wages or working environment&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, it&amp;amp;#39;s important to remember that, for the most part, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;your extra $ is going toward their superior marketing and trickery to make their brand seem &amp;amp;quot;better&amp;amp;quot;, not a truly better product.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Spend your money in places that share your values, and in this case, on an often identical or superior product. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Paying more $, in this case does not equal a better product, and in fact only gets you a more commonly marketed name, and often a more poorly performing brand in taste tests.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Edit:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; For those looking for taste tests, there are simply too many to link here, depending on which &amp;amp;quot;off brand&amp;amp;quot; you want to see tested vs the big name cereals. Google &amp;amp;quot;off brand cereal taste test&amp;amp;quot; and you&amp;amp;#39;ll find many in-depth reviews and even videos describing the look, and the taste difference (if any) of whatever brand they&amp;amp;#39;re testing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Anti-perspirant has to absorb into your skin to work and if you apply it directly after a shower while still wet; or in the morning and sweat it out it will not work (and just stain your tees!)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Applying at night, to clean DRY armpits is key. Even if you start getting sweaty before sleep, once you sleep you usually will sweat less which will allow enough time for the active ingredient to absorb. Once built up this will last days at a time and you can often get form to applying only once a week at night.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This was inspired by the EMSKR and how to apply anti perspirant was way too low on list.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit: I should probably mention that antiperspirant shouldn’t be used to prevent normal sweating. It’s a natural part of the body that helps you keep cool. If you are however excessively sweaty, first consider seeing your doctor or dermatologist. If you choose to include an anti perspirant in your routine, it’s most effective when used at  night. You also probably don’t need to use it as often as you think. Usually only every other night or a couple nights a week. Continue to apply normal deodorant in mornings as usual.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The IRS keeps a full database open to the public online &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.irs.gov/app/eos/&quot;&amp;gt;here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; where you can simply search for an organization to see if its a real non profit.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Further, if it is a nonprofit, both the organization and the IRS are required to disclose their 990 tax form, which provides their financial statements including the salary of their directors and chief officers, so you can see if half of your donation is simply going into the chairperson&amp;amp;#39;s pocket.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Tension headaches are the most common type of headache though most people unknowingly refer to them and treat them as migraines. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Migraines are a neurological problem and tension headaches are more of a muscular problem. Of course it is much more complicated than this but I’m trying to keep it as basic as possible.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I’ve suffered from tension headaches for the past 7 years that have been so bad they cost me friendships, relationships, and multiple jobs. Because of this I am very educated on tension headaches (but not so much migraines).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here’s how you can tell if you have tension headaches (and not migraines):&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Next time you have a headache take a muscle relaxer than contains ibuprofen (this is usually the purple coloured bottle). Robax platinum or any store brand version will work.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you find relief from the muscle relaxer, you likely have tension headaches, not migraines.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There are many other ways to test it such as using ice and heat as those tend to do good for tension headaches but they can also help some people with migraines, so it’s not a definite answer. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If the muscle relaxer does not relieve your pain you either have migraines or another type of headaches such as cluster headaches. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here are somethings to consider if you have tensions headaches as these are common factors in those that do. Consider fixing them as they can be the cause of your pain:
- do you grind your teeth? 
- are you low on magnesium?
- do you sleep on your side or stomach?
- do you have poor posture? 
- do you have proper tongue posture/where does your tongue sit in your mouth (it’s should be firmly pressed against the roof of your mouth). &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;not&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; relaxed. I used  to grind my teeth at night and would try to relax my whole mouth during the day to stop it. In reality this was causing more damage as one of the most important parts of good posture is having your tongue pressing against the roof of your mouth as frequently as possible) &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I have so much more advice but I don’t want to make this post too long. I hope I can help at least one person with this info :)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;1.)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Insurance will ALWAYS try to offer low first, sometimes leaving you with a balance owed on your old vehicle loan or leaving you unable to replace your vehicle with a vehicle of similar value.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2.)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; They may also try to force you to repair a vehicle which is so damaged that it will be nearly worthless &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;(or dangerous)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; after the repair.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With the price of used (and new) vehicles skyrocketing, insurance companies are pushing heavily to &amp;amp;quot;repair&amp;amp;quot; vehicles with fire damage, frame damage, firewall damage, etc; due to the high cost of replacing your vehicle often leaving you with something unsafe and also worthless to any potential buyer in the future.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;What to do:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Situation 1.)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Ask the insurance company to provide you with a list of 3 of the exact same trim of vehicle, in the same condition, with the same mileage for the $ they&amp;amp;#39;re giving you. They will be forced to give you a proper amount, in order to replace the vehicle you were paying them to insure.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Situation 2.)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Get an &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;independent estimate&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; from a reputable body shop, and if you believe your vehicle is beyond repair and ask the body shop if it were their car, would they repair it? If the answer is &amp;amp;quot;no&amp;amp;quot;, then fight your insurance company because you&amp;amp;#39;re about to get a raw deal..and possibly end up with a vehicle that&amp;amp;#39;s now dangerous and also possibly worthless to any lender or any future buyer (or any future insurance payout..)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You may be able to smell it on your new clothes. It&amp;amp;#39;s recommended that you wash all garments that will come into direct contact with your skin.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Let&amp;amp;#39;s say 8 years ago you quit a job. Later, that business discovered you were owed $50 in overtime. Legally, they have to get it to you, but realistically they aren&amp;amp;#39;t going to hire a PI to find &amp;amp;amp; verify your identity. Maybe you inherited some stocks/bonds and weren&amp;amp;#39;t notified. Where does the money go? Why, the Unclaimed Property Program! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

I found I was owed hundreds of dollars from my college apartment. My best friend was owed about $75 from an old gig. My current employer had cash from an overpaid utility bill.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s your money and it&amp;amp;#39;s free to get it back. There are BILLIONS OF DOLLARS left unclaimed in the US every year.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is not a scam. I get nothing from this. You won&amp;amp;#39;t be asked to pay a dime - if you are, it&amp;amp;#39;s a scam website. Every state has its own. You can search anywhere - make sure to search in states you&amp;amp;#39;ve lived in the past.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Steps:

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Causes:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The etiology of ingrown toenails includes direct trauma to the toe that forces the nail corners into the surrounding nail fold, genetic predisposition, improper nail trimming, poorly fitting shoes, and constant and repetitive microtrauma from normal day-to-day activities. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

If left unchecked, over time, calcareous buildups will form pretty much everywhere in the toilet&amp;amp;#39;s flushing system, which will damage the gaskets and other components in it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This also goes for pretty much anything that has tap water running through it in your home. Faucets, dishwasher, washing machine, kettle, shower head, etc. A little bit of vinegar is very efficient at getting rid of calcium deposits.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Steps:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Turn off the water&amp;amp;#39;s supply to the toilet&amp;amp;#39;s water tank, there&amp;amp;#39;s usually a knob or valve on the wall next to your toilet that you have to turn.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Open up the water tank/cistern by removing the top lid. (You may need a screwdriver to do this, depending on the model of your toilet)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;If the water tank is full, flush the water and empty it. (Because you&amp;amp;#39;ve turned off the water&amp;amp;#39;s supply, it shouldn&amp;amp;#39;t fill back up again)&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Pour white vinegar all over the flushing system and fill half of the tank with it.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Fill the remaining half of the tank with hot water (not boiling, slightly hot, max 50°C/120°F temp) and let the mixture do its thing for 15-20 minutes. You should be able to see small bubbles, that&amp;amp;#39;s a result of the white vinegar dissolving the deposits.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;If you have thick hard deposits, wear latex gloves and use a sponge to scrape off the deposits.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Once all the deposits have dissolved, flush it all down the toilet.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Turn the water&amp;amp;#39;s supply to the toilet&amp;amp;#39;s tank back on and put the lid back on.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Do this once a month, or maybe even once a week, depending on how calcareous your tap water is.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;ve just had to clean mine thoroughly because my toilet&amp;amp;#39;s flushing system stopped working properly, the water kept flushing/running. When I opened up the lid of the water tank, I was pretty horrified by the state of the flushing system. I had to replace the gaskets and had to scrape a lot of thick deposits. It was a real pain to clean... So, I now have a reminder in my phone to pour white vinegar into the toilet&amp;amp;#39;s water tank once a month to prevent this.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hopefully this is useful to someone!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

If you want to have a dog in your family it is important to teach kids how to interact with dogs safely.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;EDIT: Yes! People should train their dogs! But also it’s really important kids are taught certain elements of how to protect themselves. These are what I teach kids with families with dogs to work on safety. I am never excusing untrained dogs. I became a dog trainer because I care about dog training and well trained dogs. I am not blaming children for dog bites at all. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One thing I routinely see as a dog trainer is how many dogs are absolutely terrified of children. It’s not necessarily due to bad experience. Rather, kids move sporadically and unpredictably; they vocalize in unusual patterns. Dogs are used to human movement but children do not move in ways dogs can easily read. Many dogs will not chase an adult out for a run but will chase a child that is skipping or sprinting down the side walk. This is partially due to the unpredictable nature of the way kids move; when dogs see those kinds of movement patterns instincts to herd/chase can be activated. To keep children in your care safe around dogs here are a few simple rules I used to explain to children I worked with:
1) If you see a dog, stop running. Try not to run or skip around dogs. A lot of dogs have herding and chasing instincts, and they may see these sudden movements an invitation to run towards you. They do not want to hurt you but they may also not want to play with you. It is safest for you to never run around when you see a dog. 
2) If a dog is scared of you, it does not mean you have done something wrong. Lots of dogs have had different experiences and do not know whether strangers will be nice to them. 
3) Do not scream or shout near or at dogs, try to lower your voice if you are playing with a dog. Screaming may scare them and many dogs will act defensively when scared. They do not want to hurt you but they may be concerned that you may hurt them.
4) If you want to say hi to a dog and the owner says it is okay, make sure the dog can see your hand. Instead of reaching for the top of their head see if they will let you pet them under the chin. Instead of approaching them from the front, you can try approaching the dog from the side with your hand extended. Dogs will approach each other from the side to indicate non threatening and friendly behavior.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Corporations and ISPs like to track you as much as humanly possible within the law. They do this mostly through the DNS servers they automatically configure your devices to use. By switching to an encrypted dns server with filters that block these tracking/ad domains you won&amp;amp;#39;t see any more on your entire device. DNS is being used for tracking/ads more than any time previously in the last twenty years. It&amp;amp;#39;s only a few numbers, it&amp;amp;#39;s an easy and effortless switch. Adguard is open source and free to use like Bitcoin and Ethereum, Linux, Firefox and Tor for example.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit 2: May not work with streaming services or youtube on phones or xboxes, play stations. Google loads all their ads on one domain, so to block those domains you&amp;amp;#39;d be blocking youtube itself, alas. You can sideload cercube youtube through altstore on IOS or use youtube vanced on Android to get premium for free though (I myself use altstore, also have spotify premium for free)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Not many people are aware that &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;some&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; hospitals will offer discounts to your bill. You MUST ASK for these discounts, they aren&amp;amp;#39;t handed out like candy. Some discounts may be applied simply because you asked and were polite in doing so. Other potentially larger discounts may be applied if you can prove your income is relatively low and you are unable to pay in a timely fashion. Generally speaking, some hospitals will prefer to lower your bill and get you to pay that amount rather than send the full bill to collections. You might want to seek out hospitals that offer these discounts as opposed to ones that do not. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As an anecdote, I had low wages and a hospital bill a number of years ago. I asked for a discount and got 45% off the bill, as well as 35% off any future bills for a whole year. I did have sign a document attesting to my wages. I had insurance at the time but the bill was slightly less than my deductible.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

You are not tired of the problem, you are sceptical of the problem, so either wary or leery is what you mean. 
Unless the issue has exhausted you, you aren&amp;amp;#39;t &amp;amp;quot;weary&amp;amp;quot; of it, you&amp;amp;#39;re &amp;amp;quot;wary&amp;amp;quot; or &amp;amp;quot;leery&amp;amp;quot; of it. Learn the difference and you won&amp;amp;#39;t sound like a tool.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

It is safe for humans (but will cause diarrhea in large amounts) but CAN kill your dog very quickly unless taken to the vet IMMEDIATELY. When 5mg per 1lb of body weight is ingested, it quickly causes liver failure followed by death and the effects will begin 10-15 minutes after ingesting. Any amount less than this can cause liver cirrhosis, seizures from severe hypoglycemia, tremors, and coma in under an hour. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This sweetener is found in most “sugar free” snacks, gum, toothpaste, candies, and if you know anyone who follows a Keto Diet or is just simply diabetic, they most likely have a whole bag of the stuff in their cupboard because it tastes and bakes very similar to regular sugar. It’s even in some brands of peanut butter. With the holidays going on and everyone baking sweet treats, I thought I would mention this because until my own dog ate toothpaste with Xylitol, I had NO idea it was so dangerous. She’s fine, now. Thankfully she threw the majority of it up herself. It’s extremely easy for a pup to eat this amount of Xylitol. If you bake a sugar free cake and your dog eats it off the counter while it’s cooling, or you forget to put your toothpaste in the drawer and your curious puppy eats it like puppies do… you could have your heart broken in under an hour. So please be careful! Also never give your pup a homemade treat that you didn’t make yourself!! This info is not well known at all and a good-intending person may use xylitol in place of sugar to make the treats “healthier”. So just be careful, fellow pet owners :) &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For example if you&amp;amp;#39;re passing something, especially something like a truck with high winds, it&amp;amp;#39;s safest to pass it as quickly as possible. I always use the rule of thumb that passing should take 10 seconds maximum.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Another example is with weather that causes bad sight (think heavy fog or rain) a lot of people just slam their brakes. But it&amp;amp;#39;s way safer to just keep driving the recommended speed, since that makes you predictable. If you don&amp;amp;#39;t trust the poor vision, go to the right lane and gradually lower your speed, if you plan to go slower than 80 km/h on the highway turn on your hazards.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Heating them on a hot non-stick, flattop, plancha, or well seasoned cast iron pan for 30 seconds to a minute on each side until light browning and warm/hot is essential for enjoying the tortillas. Store in a clean folded towel or aluminum foil after cooking before eating to retain heat/moisture.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;[ EDIT ] The way this is going, I should have posted this on &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/r/unpopularopinion&quot;&amp;gt;r/unpopularopinion&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; lol. You can still have your &amp;amp;#39;not fully cooked tortillas&amp;amp;#39;, I understand they are also delicious and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;safe to consume&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. Hopefully, my internet opinion does not take that joy away from you. We can all unite knowing our fiery passion for tortillas, at any stage of their beautiful lifecycle. &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;But cooking them again is better and since I must find at least one hill these days on which to fall on my own bayonet, this will be it!&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After moving from a town in the southwest United States to a more northern, college town it has become abundantly, even PAINFULLY clear that this is not common knowledge. After seeing scores of undergrads, graduate students and grown people alike reaching their clueless hands towards a half cooked, chewy bitter tortilla for their burrito/taco/etc needs, I have elected to take a stand.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Why YSK: Tortillas are not fully cooked. Corn, Flour, or any other grain that has been wrangled into a circular shape under the name of tortillas do not come fully cooked. If they had been fully cooked prior to being packaged, they would be stiff, crunchy and frankly some unholy center point between a tortilla chip and a malleable, fresh tortilla. Thus the onus falls on you, the consumer to bring these glorious circles of flavor up to the correct temperature, finish the cooking/rising, and bring a bitter/raw flavor of uncooked corn and flour to their glorious savory and delicious conclusion.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How: The best and most traditional way would be a &amp;amp;#39;plancha&amp;amp;#39; (think: a flat top griddle that gets exceptionally hot), but a non-stick pan or well seasoned cast-iron pan will do the job just as well. Get your choice of heat delivery device rippin&amp;amp;#39; hot (mid-high) and start dropping tortillas. Times will vary based on heat of your burners, type of pan etc, but you should look for some light to medium browning and spots on each side. Tortillas are cheap! Try a few different levels of done-ness to see how you like them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;NOTE: Huge bonus points to use your fingers when grabbing a flipping tortillas. You will make a Mexican/South American grandmother very happy somewhere. The technique varies from surface to surface, but my preferred way is a light pinch to flip, or using the curved edge of the pan and my four fingers to draw it up, allowing my thumb to get under the tortilla and toss it down on the other side. Obviously, don&amp;amp;#39;t do anything you are not comfortable with, and this technique benefits from both speed and the presence of &amp;amp;quot;kitchen fingers&amp;amp;quot; (Where my food service people at?). This saves scratches on a pan, and is much faster/efficient than some metal tool or spatula.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As soon as the tortilla leaves the griddle, you should be tossing it somewhere that helps it retain its heat and moisture. My personal favorite is making a small foil pouch, pinched on 3 sides with a fold on the forth, that can perfectly be sealed and unsealed as I build a stack of hot and steamy tortillas inside. The same technique can be done with a clean, folded towel. This steam is part of the cooking process, it softens to tortillas up a bit, and helps retain moisture, and finishes the cooking process with the heat. (In fact this is a great technique for many other foods. ever wonder why ballpark hotdogs, wrapped burritos, wrapped burgers taste so good? Part of that process is letting the heat from the steam and meat flow into the bread and keep it warm and moist. A good technique for other items too!)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Take these tortillas out as you are ready to eat them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;BONUS:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;carniceria/tortilleria : While most places may not have access to one of these stores, it is worth a quick map search. Tortillas from actual Latino/Hispanic grocers are much better than anything from a grocery store. Same rules apply for finishing cooking these tortillas. Plus, you will be supporting small businesses! These stores additionally often have a plethora of other Latin/Hispanic ingredients, seasonings, meats, pastries etc. and are often cheaper than chain grocery store equivalents (and better tasting!). Be kind and respectful of culture and language here too. I have never had a negative experience even though my Spanish is &amp;amp;#39;mierda&amp;amp;#39;, and the same service industry rules apply here: Hardworking people deserve respect and empathy, so don&amp;amp;#39;t be an asshole. Should go without saying, but still.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Too much focus is put on the workout itself without addressing the real problem of why so many start and then quit. Everyone struggles, but some have sourced the key, the right mental gymnastics to continue the regimen despite regular life pressures getting in the way.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After a lifetime of joking the #1 cause of injury is exercise, I found myself at a crossroads when I had to run about 30 meters (100 feet). I was a mess, barely able to breathe. I loosened my shirt and my pants. I knew i wasn’t in good shape but I hadn’t considered I was in terrible shape.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I started walking around the block, then longer, then jogging small parts, then jogging most of it, then moved on to hiking. I learned my body prefers Interval training, so I focused on this whether it was around the neighbourhood or into the woods.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After 3 months I was noticeably more fit but I was still struggling mentally with just getting out the door. I always had SO MANY reasons to not exercise today, mostly related to urgency of other matters. Put simply, I would find important distractions and then convince myself it was “too late” to do it today and to try again tomorrow.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It took about 6 months of mental retraining to stop this bad habit while also convincing myself I enjoyed it. Some tricks I used:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1 - Whatever other urgent thing you have to do, don&amp;amp;#39;t argue with yourself on the priority  If you have a nagging mind like I do, I found it easier to just agree with the thought to skip today and then just do the exercise anyways.  Its like the old adage of not what you say, but what you do.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2 - Any opportunity I had to talk about my training, I did so and said how much I loved it. Even though I was lying, I said I loved it and I said it to myself regularly as well. Weirdly, after awhile you start to actually love it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;3 - Meditation, It helped a lot learning how to “let thoughts go”, even important valid thoughts. Just because something is important, it doesn’t mean it’s more important than your health. Let the valid and important thought go along with any other thoughts and do your exercises&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;4 - Find anyone to do it with. Your friends keep you honest. Or get a dog. That sad look they give you, or excited when they hear keys, it really works. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;5 - Upper body and general muscle development are key not just for balance, but muscles burn more calories. You may not be as toned as the person putting in a couple hours a day, but any increase in muscle makes a better working body that burns more calories for the same amount of work. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;6 - Even if its just 5 minutes. This is my go to when nothing else is working. It&amp;amp;#39;s amazing how taking 5 minutes can turn into 15 and then into 30. And you feel like a boss afterwards.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;7 - Keep mixing it up. I go one day at the gym, then a neighborhood walk, then Beat Sabre, then a good hike, and then just drive somewhere new. I found I failed when it&amp;amp;#39;s just the same thing over and over, every week, forever. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It’s been 4 years now and I do love it and look forward to it each week. BUT!... I still mentally struggle with it. Or I should say the desire to skip it is always on the perimeter trying to get back in, and when it does, I just take my toolkit out and use one of my tricks to get back into it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Make this the year you make it stick. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

It&amp;amp;#39;s odourless and colourless, so it&amp;amp;#39;s very hard to detect.   For this reason, it&amp;amp;#39;s always a good idea to ensure your fire detector/smoke alarm also has CO detection  (most of the newer fire detectors come standard with this nowadays).      &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;amp;#39;m making this post because I noticed a lot of black soot (black powdery substance) building up on the bottom of my girlfriend&amp;amp;#39;s pots and pans when we cook at her condo.  I also have a gas range stove at my place but have never seen build-up of soot on my cooking equipment.  This soot will come off as black dust on your finger if you rub the bottom of a pan after it cools.  Recently, the CO alarm went off on the smoke detector at my girlfriend&amp;amp;#39;s place, which obviously caused some concern and I started to look into the potential causes while she called the fire department.  Be sure to get out of the house and/or ventilated it by opening the windows.  Getting out of the home right away is the safest option and highly recommended. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One of the best articles I found was this one:   &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.abe.iastate.edu/extension-and-outreach/carbon-monoxide-poisoning-checking-for-complete-combustion-aen-175/&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.abe.iastate.edu/extension-and-outreach/carbon-monoxide-poisoning-checking-for-complete-combustion-aen-175/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The article shows that soot can be a sign that your natural gas stove is has an incorrect mixture of air and gas, which can lead to an incomplete burn.  This incomplete burn can cause the build-up of soot and carbon monoxide in your home.   While this typically creates CO in amounts that are not deadly, they can cause a lot of health problems over time and if the ventilation in your home is poor, it can potentially be fatal. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some symptoms of CO poisoning are headaches, shortness of breath, dizziness, weaknesss, confusion, and nausea.  If you have any of these symptoms that seem to clear up when you leave home, check the bottom of your pots and pans for clues.    The article above goes into a lot better detail than I ever could, and I&amp;amp;#39;m definitely no expert in this field.   I figured this could be life-saving information and was worth a share.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The smallest amount of antifreeze can kill cats, and kill them horribly. Signs can show within 30 minutes of ingestion; they begin to stumble like they are drunk, start to find breathing difficult. They vomit, they can have seizures. Finally, their kidneys give out. It is absolutely horrific for pet and owner.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I know this from experience, having lost &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/gallery/4ZzwTLh&quot;&amp;gt;two cats&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; to antifreeze poisoning in the space of one week.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;*The worst thing about antifreeze is it&amp;amp;#39;s active ingredient, Ethylene Glycol, has an appealing, sweet taste. Once found, your pet will continue you eat it. Not knowing they are killing themselves.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#39;s also vital to know &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rspca.org.uk/adviceandwelfare/pets/cats/health/poisoning/antifreeze&quot;&amp;gt;the symptoms&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; of antifreeze poisoning, as depending on dosage it only takes 2-3 days for your kitty&amp;amp;#39;s kidneys to fail, and the cat to pass.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Please please please, save a cat this Christmas. Store, dispose of and use any antifreeze safely, or buy pet-safe antifreeze (that doesn&amp;amp;#39;t contain ethylene glycol).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

Thoracic or chest breathing is better for physical exertion and may actually make you more tense. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/in-depth/decrease-stress-by-using-your-breath/art-20267197&quot;&amp;gt;(Source: Mayo Clinic)&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; Knowing how to use diaphragmatic breathing can help you calm down in stressful situations and potentially avoid a panic attack. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;From the link above, for those who don’t want to read the whole thing: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;•Get into a comfortable position. Close your eyes and bring your attention to your body and breath.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;•Inhale deeply through your nose, allowing your abdomen to fill with air, gently expanding out. Exhale by relaxing and releasing all of the air through your nose.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;•Place one hand on your abdomen, right below your navel, and the other hand on your upper chest. Take a deep breath in through your nose and out through your nose. Feel the coolness of the air as it enters in and the warmth as it flows out.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;•As you breathe in and out through your nose, focus on shifting your breath so that you can feel the rise and fall of your breathing in your abdomen more than in your chest. In other words, make the hand that rests on your abdomen move more than the hand on your chest. Take a deep breath in through your nose, sending it through the back of your throat and down to your belly. Let your abdomen slowly deflate as you exhale through your nose.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;•Take three more slow, deep breaths with conscious focus on the rise and fall of your abdomen. Continue to breathe fully and deeply, allowing and trusting the body as the breath slows and becomes more relaxed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Edit 1: Thank you to &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/u/inspirationisagift&quot;&amp;gt;u/inspirationisagift&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; for adding this info in a comment, because it’s actually really useful!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Using a breathing method like box breathing/square breathing has been empirically supported as an alternative method that helps with panic attacks and times of high stress/anxiety as it brings the oxygen level down. This method deactivates the &amp;amp;#39;fight flight freeze&amp;amp;#39; stress response which relies on increased levels of oxygen.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Deep breathing can sometimes give the body that extra oxygen which keeps the body in a stressed state, wheras by reducing respiration/oxygen intake, it helps to activate the &amp;amp;#39;rest and digest&amp;amp;#39; system instead. Just in case anyone has found deep breathing to not be helpful 🙂&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

It is important to not overwater your houseplants as they can grow mold, mildew, or be susceptible to fungus and other diseases with excessive water. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A good rule of thumb is to touch the soil with your finger to see if the substrate is moist, and avoid watering again until it is dry. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also, leaf tips can go brown from cold. Do not cut these off until warmer weather arrives, as this is one of the plant’s protection against frost. They essentially write off a part of themselves to take the damage from the cold in order to protect the rest of them. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Good luck, and happy gardening!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
