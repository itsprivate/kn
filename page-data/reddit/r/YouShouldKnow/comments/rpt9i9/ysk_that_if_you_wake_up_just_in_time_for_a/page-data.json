When you work from home people don’t have all the same data as they do if they can see you, read your body language, and see how hard you’re working. They don’t know what kind of day you’ve had. All people have to go off of is what you type, how you sound, and what work you get done. I genuinely believe how you sound is important if you’re customer-facing.
