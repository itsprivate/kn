What most homeowners don&#39;t realize is that many construction projects aren&#39;t profitable for the company, and some will actually lose money.</p>\n\n<p>The point of the free estimate is to size up your job, and to see if it will make money. If it seems like a bad bet, contractors will price the job higher, to account for the risk. </p>\n\n<p>You should see this as a polite way of refusing the job. </p>\n\n<p>If you get three estimates, you&#39;ll notice if one is a lot higher. Don&#39;t go with that one. The contractor is either inexperienced, doesn&#39;t have the time, or doesn&#39;t have the equipment.</p>\n\n<p>If all the estimates are roughly the same, congratulations. Your job is one that will be completed without issues. Pick the middle bid.</p>\n\n<p>If one bid is a lot lower than the rest, don&#39;t go with that one. The contractor has likely missed a major line item and will be forced to bail on your project, or take a big loss. The quality of the work will likely not be as good as it needs to be. Please don&#39;t see this as a way to get a good deal. </p>\n\n<p>TLDR: in most cases, if you are excellent to your contractor they will be excellent to you.</p>\n\n<p>Source: I was a contractor.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/mb3jgr/ysk_always_get_three_estimates_for_any_large/","title":"YSK: Always get three estimates for any large construction project","tags":["YouShouldKnow","reddit"],"date":"March 23, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-23T12:43:11.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-23 12:43","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"mb3jgr","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/mb3jgr/ysk_always_get_three_estimates_for_any_large/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/mb3jgr/ysk_always_get_three_estimates_for_any_large/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"YouShouldKnow","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow","author":"rhinokitty","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/rhinokitty","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"rhinokitty","score":70,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"YSK: 任何大型建筑项目都要进行三次评估。","the_new_excerpt":"为什么是YSK：到你家给你免费评估的人，往往都是 \"你\"。\n在压力下，赢取大回报的工作。大多数业主所\n不知道的是，很多建筑项目都是无利可图的。\n公司，有的还会实际亏损。\n\n免费的点...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"YSK: 任何大型建築項目都要進行三次評估。","the_new_excerpt":"爲什麼是YSK：到你家給你免費評估的人，往往都是 \"你\"。\n在壓力下，贏取大回報的工作。大多數業主所\n不知道的是，很多建築項目都是無利可圖的。\n公司，有的還會實際虧損。\n\n免費的點...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-malse0","excerpt":"This is true for all disposable battery cells, alkaline, and salt-based.
