This means your mail carrier and package delivery people including companies like Amazon even are working long hours and are on a strict timeline, and may even get extra work thrown on them if they complete their work quick enough and not really be given notice/time to prepare. Plus they can&amp;#39;t exactly carry and bunch of food/drinks (especially in cities) to last all day. Doing small things like leaving a bottle of water in the mailbox (marked for them, otherwise they may not take it due to a fear of theft claims) or a cooler even clearly marked &amp;quot;help yourself delivery people&amp;quot; can make a huge difference in their day. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My mom worked mail delivery for years and she always would point out the houses with glee as we drive through our small town that she remembered would have a bottle of water or snack waiting for her even when she was just a sub, as in didn&amp;#39;t even have a set route every workday. When she got a set route some customers would even go as far as leaving her home made cookies and gift cards for coffee or lunch occasionally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR; Appreciate the people who even though are just doing their job, still keep doing it even when it&amp;#39;s not even what they signed up for. You may just be another house if you don&amp;#39;t, but you will probably be a highlight of a strangers day if you do and in today&amp;#39;s world we need more of that!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit; if you are someone delivering please say what country/area of the country/service and what would help you whatever time of the year and any rules you have to follow to accept anything. About to go to sleep, but when I wake up sometime tomorrow I will edit again and add a list as best I can for anyone trying to set up care packages! Obviously water and snacks, but based off a comment I realized I&amp;#39;ve got a bunch of cheap shake to activate hand warmers that could really be nice for someone out all day. I also know some companies have policies where &amp;quot;helping themselves&amp;quot; could be reported in today&amp;#39;s day and age so we could avoid it being a worry I&amp;#39;d like to know how! :) Have a good night/day everyone!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","slug":"/reddit/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/rdwhij/ysk_leaving_water_bottlessnacks_for_any_delivery/","title":"YSK leaving water bottles/snacks for any delivery or mail service this time of year can mean a lot to someone","tags":["YouShouldKnow","reddit"],"date":"December 11, 2021","dateISO":"2021-12-11T15:49:14.000Z","datetime":"2021-12-11 15:49","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"rdwhij","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/rdwhij/ysk_leaving_water_bottlessnacks_for_any_delivery/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/rdwhij/ysk_leaving_water_bottlessnacks_for_any_delivery/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"YouShouldKnow","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow","author":"Mbayer92","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Mbayer92","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Mbayer92","score":137,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"YSKはこの時期、宅配便やメール便に水筒やスナックを置いておくと、誰かに喜ばれます。","the_new_excerpt":"<!--SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>なぜYSKなのかというと、この時期、さらには\n今年は特に（少なくとも私の知る限りアメリカでは）、郵便や荷物のサービスが完全に過剰になっています。\nこの時期、そして今年は特に（少なくとも私の知る限りアメリカでは）、郵便や小包のサービスが完全に行き届いています。これは、あなたの郵便配達人や荷物配達人が\nこれでは、郵便局員や宅配業者、アマゾンなどの企業までもが...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"YSK在每年的这个时候为任何快递或邮件服务留下水瓶/零食，对某人来说意味着很多。","the_new_excerpt":"<! -- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>为什么YSK，每年的这个时候，甚至更多的是\n今年更是如此（据我所知，至少在美国），邮件和包裹\n服务是完全不堪重负的。这意味着你的邮递员和包裹\n包括像亚马逊这样的公司在内的快递员甚至都...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"YSK在每年的這個時候爲任何快遞或郵件服務留下水瓶/零食，對某人來說意味着很多。","the_new_excerpt":"<! -- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>爲什麼YSK，每年的這個時候，甚至更多的是\n今年更是如此（據我所知，至少在美國），郵件和包裹\n服務是完全不堪重負的。這意味着你的郵遞員和包裹\n包括像亞馬遜這樣的公司在內的快遞員甚至都...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-rdt0d3","excerpt":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Why YSK: Most people are unaware that\neducational sites provide 100% off coupons for promotion which literally make\nthose courses FREE to enroll with lifetime validity.</p> <p>Here is the <a\nhref=\"https://coursetime.net/\">Website</a> that keep a track of those…","slug":"/reddit/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/rdt0d3/ysk_there_is_an_website_that_offers_paid_courses/","title":"YSK: There is an website that offers paid courses for FREE from sites like udemy,Coursera,edx and many more legally using coupons","date":"December 11, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"YSK: udemy、Coursera、edxなどの有料コースをクーポンを使って合法的に無料で提供しているサイトがあります。","the_new_excerpt":"<!--SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>なぜYSKなのか：ほとんどの人は、教育用のサイトが100%OCDを提供していることを知りません。\n販促用に100％オフのクーポンを提供していることを知らない人が多いです。\n</p> <p>ここでは、<a\nhref=\"https://coursetime.net/\">Webサイト</a>には、これらのクーポンの記録が残っています。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"YSK: 有一个网站可以免费提供udemy,Coursera,edx等网站的付费课程，并可以合法使用优惠券。","the_new_excerpt":"<! -- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>为什么YSK：大多数人都没有意识到\n教育网站提供100%的促销优惠券，这实际上使\n</p> <p>这里是</p> <p>教育网站提供100%折扣的促销券，这实际上使这些课程可以免费注册，并且终身有效。\nhref=\"https://coursetime.net/\">网站</a>，该网站记录了这些信息。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"YSK: 有一個網站可以免費提供udemy,Coursera,edx等網站的付費課程，並可以合法使用優惠券。","the_new_excerpt":"<! -- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>爲什麼YSK：大多數人都沒有意識到\n教育網站提供100%的促銷優惠券，這實際上使\n</p> <p>這裏是</p> <p>教育網站提供100%折扣的促銷券，這實際上使這些課程可以免費註冊，並且終身有效。\nhref=\"https://coursetime.net/\">網站</a>，該網站記錄了這些信息。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-rdwhij","previousId":"RedditPost-rdt0d3","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/rdwhij/ysk_leaving_water_bottlessnacks_for_any_delivery/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},
