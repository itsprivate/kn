However I see a lot of young adults or older people who have a super strong disliking toward kids for simply being kids. Kids just kind of do stuff or mimic what they see. They are very underdeveloped compared to adults and don’t know any better most of the time. </p>\n\n<p>For example a kid and his mom were filming a cooking video together and he almost put his hand in a blender. His mom stopped him before anything bad could happen. However a lot of the comments were adults angry over how he almost hurt himself while talking about their disliking for kids in general. Some even wished he put his hand in the blender to “learn his lesson”. </p>\n\n<p>Again, I totally get that kids can be tough to handle. But to hope and wish a kid would severely hurt himself because he was curious or just not knowing any better is very weird and crazy to me. </p>\n\n<p>Basically just try to be nice to everyone plz. Kids deserve to not be judged and should be able to live up some of their best moments in life without adults being rude to them.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/m0c6m3/ysk_adults_shouldnt_hate_or_be_rude_to_kids/","title":"YSK - Adults shouldn’t hate or be rude to kids","tags":["YouShouldKnow","reddit"],"date":"March 12, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-12T03:56:56.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-12 03:56","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"m0c6m3","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/m0c6m3/ysk_adults_shouldnt_hate_or_be_rude_to_kids/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/m0c6m3/ysk_adults_shouldnt_hate_or_be_rude_to_kids/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"YouShouldKnow","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow","author":"Illustrious_Sun267","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Illustrious_Sun267","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Illustrious_Sun267","score":51,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"YSK - 成人不应该讨厌或粗鲁地对待孩子们","the_new_excerpt":"为什么选择YSK：很高兴能让大家认识到这个话题，并希望能帮助引导大家。\n到更积极的关系。\n\n我知道孩子们可能会非常沮丧地处理，甚至是烦人的。\n的时候。然而我看到很多的年轻人或者是老年人，他们有一个超\n对孩子们的强烈厌恶，因为...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"YSK - 成人不應該討厭或粗魯地對待孩子們","the_new_excerpt":"爲什麼選擇YSK：很高興能讓大家認識到這個話題，並希望能幫助引導大家。\n到更積極的關係。\n\n我知道孩子們可能會非常沮喪地處理，甚至是煩人的。\n的時候。然而我看到很多的年輕人或者是老年人，他們有一個超\n對孩子們的強烈厭惡，因爲...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m2mw66","excerpt":"Why YSK: That way the animal won't get caught in it.","slug":"/reddit/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/m2mw66/ysk_when_you_get_something_that_has_a_hole_that/","title":"YSK: When you get something that has a hole that an animal could end up trapped in, make sure to cut it before throwing it away.","date":"March 11, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"YSK: 当你得到的东西有一个洞，动物可能会被困在里面，一定要在扔掉之前把它剪掉。","the_new_excerpt":"为什么YSK：这样动物就不会被抓进去了。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"YSK: 當你得到的東西有一個洞，動物可能會被困在裏面，一定要在扔掉之前把它剪掉。","the_new_excerpt":"爲什麼YSK：這樣動物就不會被抓進去了。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-m2xzxh","excerpt":"Edit: If you want a book recommendation I recommend “How to Deal with\nEmotionally Explosive People” by Albert Bernstein.
