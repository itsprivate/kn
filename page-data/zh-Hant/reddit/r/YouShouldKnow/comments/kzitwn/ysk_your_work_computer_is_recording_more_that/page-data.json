You would be surprised what information is actually recorded. Working in the information security side of the house, I happen to have access to this kind of stuff. So what can I see? I can see every Teams chat message, every SharePoint file, every email you sent or received. I can query this information in different ways, I can search for everyone in the organization who has wrote about, sent a chat about, emailed, saved a file with the specific word I am looking for. </p>\n\n<p>Internet</p>\n\n<p>If your organizations IT department is worth two shits, they are logging what websites people are going to. It is old school and extremely easy to implement. Now if your organization actually has a good IT department, it could be much worse. Many places now even have SSL intercept, which basically means even on a secure website, every thing you enter or submit on a page gets logged. </p>\n\n<p>Apps</p>\n\n<p>This is another basic one. We can see if you put Steam on your work computer. Hopefully your IT department does not just let you install your own apps, but some do. If they do limit you from doing that and you think you are so smart using portable versions of your applications, yeah we can see that too.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why YSK:</strong> So you don&#39;t get fired thinking working from home means I can shop for cat slippers on Amazon all day long.
