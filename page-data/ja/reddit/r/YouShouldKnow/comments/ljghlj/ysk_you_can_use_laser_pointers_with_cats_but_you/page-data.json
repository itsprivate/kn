There are good indoor alternative toys that I can recommend if anyone’s interested.  </p>\n\n<p>I found this out a long time ago but realized I should post this after seeing an LPT promoting it.</p>\n\n<p>Sources if you’re interested in reading more: <a href=\"https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/lifestyle/laser-pointers-more-frustration-than-fun/\">#1</a> <a href=\"https://www.rauanimalhospital.com/resources/blog/cats-dogs/laser-pointers-good-idea-your-cat-not-your-dog\">#2</a> <a href=\"https://dogpsychology101.com/laser-pointer-syndrome-dogs/\">#3</a></p>\n\n<p>Edit: I’m getting a lot of people saying that it’s not good for cats either, and I do agree that for any animal a physical toy is the best. </p>\n\n<p><strong>However, the average cat can play with laser pointers without issue as long as it’s done right - you should always end the play by putting it on a physical toy for them to attack.</strong></p>\n\n<p>BUT, you should always try to understand how your cat is responding to the laser pointer and if you feel that it is negative then definitely don’t do it. I hope this post at the very least will cause people to research something that they may not have known about, and hopefully save some animals from unnecessary anxiety. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://petcube.com/blog/is-it-bad-for-cats-to-play-with-laser-pointers/\">Here’s</a> a website covering the pros/cons and how-to of using a laser pointer with cats.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/ljghlj/ysk_you_can_use_laser_pointers_with_cats_but_you/","title":"YSK you can use laser pointers with cats, but you should NOT use them with dogs","tags":["YouShouldKnow","reddit"],"date":"February 14, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-14T13:25:36.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-14 13:25","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"ljghlj","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/ljghlj/ysk_you_can_use_laser_pointers_with_cats_but_you/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/ljghlj/ysk_you_can_use_laser_pointers_with_cats_but_you/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"YouShouldKnow","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow","author":"bobby_pendragon","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/bobby_pendragon","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"bobby_pendragon","score":5858,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"YSK，你可以对猫咪使用激光笔，但不应该对狗使用。","the_new_excerpt":"为什么YSK：与猫相比，狗是更多的触觉动物，它们需要\n的东西来玩，才能正确理解它。\n\n使用激光笔可能看起来很有趣，因为它可以锻炼他们，而不需要\n任何工作，但它实际上是导致他们的焦虑和潜在的问题... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"YSK，你可以對貓咪使用激光筆，但不應該對狗使用。","the_new_excerpt":"爲什麼YSK：與貓相比，狗是更多的觸覺動物，它們需要\n的東西來玩，才能正確理解它。\n\n使用激光筆可能看起來很有趣，因爲它可以鍛鍊他們，而不需要\n任何工作，但它實際上是導致他們的焦慮和潛在的問題... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lhjx3w","excerpt":"Why YSK: It is a lifesaving asset in an emergency where your pets needs\nimmediate first aid, and you get to spend more time with your fluffy friends if\nyou ever need to use it.\n\nEdit: Useful link-\nhttps://www.pdsa.org.uk/taking-care-of-your-pet/looking-after-your-pet/all-pets/giving-cpr-to-pets","slug":"/reddit/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/lhjx3w/ysk_how_to_perform_cpr_on_household_pets/","title":"YSK How to perform CPR on household pets","date":"February 14, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"YSK如何对家养宠物进行心肺复苏？","the_new_excerpt":"为什么选择YSK: 它是在您的宠物需要的紧急情况下的救命工具。\n即时急救，你可以花更多的时间与你的毛茸茸的朋友，如果。\n你曾经需要使用它。\n\n编辑: 有用的链接-\nhttps://www.pdsa.org.uk/taking-care-of-your-pet/looking-after-your-pet/all-pets/giving-cpr-to-pets","locale":"zh"},{"title":"YSK如何對家養寵物進行心肺復甦？","the_new_excerpt":"爲什麼選擇YSK: 它是在您的寵物需要的緊急情況下的救命工具。\n即時急救，你可以花更多的時間與你的毛茸茸的朋友，如果。\n你曾經需要使用它。\n\n編輯: 有用的鏈接-\nhttps://www.pdsa.org.uk/taking-care-of-your-pet/looking-after-your-pet/all-pets/giving-cpr-to-pets","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-ljd533","excerpt":"Why YSK: If candle wax reaches its flash point (appx 400F) and catches fire,\nblowing on it will create a larger flame and spread droplets of flaming molten\nwax everywhere.
