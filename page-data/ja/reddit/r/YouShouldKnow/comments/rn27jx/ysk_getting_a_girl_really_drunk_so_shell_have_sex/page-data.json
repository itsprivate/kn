In one very popular film I rewatched recently (Superbad), Jonah hill jokes that parties are for getting girls really drunk so they’ll sleep with you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With recent personal events this shocked me that such a popular film would joke about something like that and normalise it. If you sleep with someone (whether it’s a man/woman) who is blackout drunk and likely would never even consider sleeping with you sober THAT IS RAPE, there was no consent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you’re still reading also please read up on symptoms of Rohypnol/ GHB (date rape drugs). Many people think being spiked looks like you’re really drunk, unable to speak or walk but the reality is often VERY different. They can make you euphoric, lose inhibition, increase sense of connection with others, influence decision making and increase libido. If the spiker knows what they’re doing it can be so hard to spot and it’s so important to look out for your friends and ANY indication they may have been spiked GET TESTED ASAP. These drugs only stay in your system for a few hours and we need to start catching these bastards!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Take care, have a good Christmas for those who celebrate it :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please stop making this a gender thing, I literally say man/woman&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My post has actually shocked me seeing this level of hatred in the comments and comments saying “well what about &lt;em&gt;insert men’s issue&lt;/em&gt;” NOT EVERYTHING IS A MENS VS WOMEN COMPETITION &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don’t comment on posts about men’s mental health and suicide rates saying “oh yeah well women are more likely to get raped so that’s the real issue”ygm?? They’re BOTH issues, let them both exist&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","slug":"/reddit/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/rn27jx/ysk_getting_a_girl_really_drunk_so_shell_have_sex/","title":"YSK getting a girl really drunk so she’ll have sex with you IS RAPE","tags":["YouShouldKnow","reddit"],"date":"December 24, 2021","dateISO":"2021-12-24T07:54:14.000Z","datetime":"2021-12-24 07:54","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"rn27jx","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/rn27jx/ysk_getting_a_girl_really_drunk_so_shell_have_sex/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/rn27jx/ysk_getting_a_girl_really_drunk_so_shell_have_sex/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"YouShouldKnow","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow","author":"thatbitchlol","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/thatbitchlol","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"thatbitchlol","score":565,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"YSK 女の子を酔わせてセックスさせるのは強姦だ","the_new_excerpt":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Why YSK: 被害者に長い間影響を与えることができます。\n</p> <p>私にとっては、このようなことはとても重要です。\n私が見た映画では、その多くが知らず知らずのうちにレイプ文化を助長しています。その中で\n最近見返した大人気映画（スーパーバッド）で、ジョナ...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"YSK让女孩喝得酩酊大醉，以便她与你发生性关系是强奸。","the_new_excerpt":"<! -- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>为什么YSK：它可以影响受害者很长一段时间\n潜在地使你陷入很多困境</p> <p>在我看来，根据我所看到的电影，许多人都在不知不觉中宣扬强奸文化。\n在我所看到的电影中，许多人都在不知不觉地促进强奸文化。在\n我最近重新观看的一部非常受欢迎的电影（《超级大坏蛋》），乔纳...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"YSK讓女孩喝得酩酊大醉，以便她與你發生性關係是強姦。","the_new_excerpt":"<! -- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>爲什麼YSK：它可以影響受害者很長一段時間\n潛在地使你陷入很多困境</p> <p>在我看來，根據我所看到的電影，許多人都在不知不覺中宣揚強姦文化。\n在我所看到的電影中，許多人都在不知不覺地促進強姦文化。在\n我最近重新觀看的一部非常受歡迎的電影（《超級大壞蛋》），喬納...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-rn6dl3","excerpt":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Why YSK: A simple lack in knowledge of\nsymptoms could be all that is required for the death of you and/or your\nfriends/loved ones.</p> <p>My sister and her husband could&#39;ve died.</p> <p>I\noverheard my sister telling our mom that she is still losing hair and…","slug":"/reddit/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/rn6dl3/ysk_the_symptoms_of_carbon_monoxide_co_poisoning/","title":"YSK: The Symptoms of Carbon Monoxide (CO) Poisoning","date":"December 24, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"YSK: 一酸化炭素(CO)中毒の症状について","the_new_excerpt":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Why YSK: 単純な知識不足。\nを、その症状に応じて使い分ける必要があります。\n</p> <p>私の姉と彼女の夫は死んだかもしれません。\n姉が母に「まだ髪の毛が抜けている」と話しているのを聞いて...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"YSK：一氧化碳（CO）中毒的症状","the_new_excerpt":"<! -- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>为什么YSK：一个简单的缺乏症状知识的人可能是你和/或你的家人死亡的全部原因。\n症状可能就是你和/或你的朋友/亲人死亡的全部原因。\n</p> <p>我的姐姐和她的丈夫可能已经死了。\n</p> <p>我无意中听到我妹妹告诉我们的妈妈，她仍然在脱发，而且......。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"YSK：一氧化碳（CO）中毒的症狀","the_new_excerpt":"<! -- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>爲什麼YSK：一個簡單的缺乏症狀知識的人可能是你和/或你的家人死亡的全部原因。\n症狀可能就是你和/或你的朋友/親人死亡的全部原因。\n</p> <p>我的姐姐和她的丈夫可能已經死了。\n</p> <p>我無意中聽到我妹妹告訴我們的媽媽，她仍然在脫髮，而且......。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-rn27jx","previousId":"RedditPost-rn6dl3","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/rn27jx/ysk_getting_a_girl_really_drunk_so_shell_have_sex/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},
