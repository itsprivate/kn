Many people are desperate to find somewhere to belong, and this desperation is often taken advantage of by groups that either have an ulterior motive or just relish fucking shit up. They do this by claiming feeling shitty about yourself is just what life is, and that anyone who doesn&#39;t believe that is fake or delusional, effectively sowing the seeds for further isolation from people you might have formed a genuine connection with. </p>\n\n<p>Bad emotions are part of the human experience, and it&#39;s important to acknowledge that it&#39;s okay to feel shitty sometimes (and conditions such as depression are very real), but you&#39;re not going to be any happier unless you allow yourself to change. And yeah, change is scary. But it&#39;s better than cyclical doom.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ll end this by sending internet hugs to each and every one of you who need one. Take care of yourselves.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Aw, shucks. You honour me. Thank you for the &#39;thank you&#39;s, the shiny awards, and for checking in on my wellbeing (I&#39;m okay). To those wondering - I am not referring to any group in particular, but if you&#39;re in one that seems to fit the bill, perhaps you&#39;ll find some help <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/wiki/resources\">here</a>. To those commenting &quot;no shit&quot; and the like - I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve got things figured out.
